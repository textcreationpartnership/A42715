            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Whatsoever thy Belief, Judgment or Opinion may be concerning God, Christ, Scriptures of Truth or Religion, &amp;c. this know assuredly, That God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things, is a pure unalterable Fountain of Love, and they who dwell in him they dwell in Love, not only to him, but also one to another, and to their very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Further, <hi>And though I speak with the Tongue of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and have not Charity, I am become as a sounding Brass or as a tinkling Simbal; and though I bestow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and though I give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing: Charity suffereth long, and is kind; Charity envyeth not; Charity vaunteth not it self? it is not puffed up,</hi> chap. 13. read it through. The word <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> signifies <hi>Love:</hi> The Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>God is Love, and he that dwells in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him</hi> [mark, Reader, <hi>God in him</hi>] (My present Adversary, <hi>J.

The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Love worketh no ill to his Neighbour, therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law, Also owe no man any thing, but to Love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law,</hi> Rom. 13. Vers. 10, 8. <hi>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> Gal. 5.14. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>For he that will love Life, and see good Dayes, let him refrain his Tongue from Evil, and his Lips that they speak no Guile, let him eschew Evil, and do good, let him seek Peace, and follow it; for the Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, &amp; his Ear is open unto their Prayers, but the Face of the Lord is against them that do Evil,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Reader,</hi> I desire thou mayst seriously in the Fear of God read
<pb facs="tcp:96767:3"/>the following Treatise without Prejudice and Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if thou so readest, I doubt not but it will appear unto thee that <hi>John Cheyney</hi> hath been much out of the Bounds of the Love of God and Christian-Charity in his Writings against the People call'd <hi>Quakers;</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire he may come to a right Sense of it, &amp; Repent, &amp; be forgiven of God, and come into God's Love, and abide therein, and into the Charity which doth not behave it self unseemly; and until he come into this Love and Charity, his Sacrifice will not be accepted of God: I commend thee to the Manifestation of God's Spirit, which is given unto thee to instruct thee in those things that appertain to his Kingdom; and without the Help of the Spirit of God no man can know the things of God, as its written.</p>

            <head>THE Life of God, Which is the Light and Salvation of Men, EXALTED</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IOhn Cheyney</hi> condemneth the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the Book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Quakerism subverted,</hi> page 31. for affirming, that the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, with which every Man is enlightned, is sufficient to Everlasting Salvation, — and that this Light within is utterly Blameless, so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Sins and Abominations men run into, the Light within is utterly Blameless, and no way partaking in the Crime, nor any wayes chargeable with the Guilt. The priest's Answer to this is, <hi>In this lieth the Heart of the Controversie, if this be True and Sound, the</hi> Quakers <hi>are in the Right, if this be so, all that I have writ against them, as also what is alledged in my</hi> Skirmish, <hi>all falls to the Ground, and I will confess my self defeated, and to have lost the Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, all things were made by him, in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men; that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.1, 3, 4, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This then is the Message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, then have we Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96767:6"/>us from all Sin,</hi> 1 John 5.7 Christ saith, <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that follows me shall not walk in Darkness, but he shall have the Light of Life,</hi> John 8.12.12, 46. <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation,</hi> Psal. 27.1. 2 Sam. 22.29. And <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord shall be unto thee an Everlasting Light,</hi> Isa. 60.20. Christ is set to be a <hi>Light to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>to be God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Luke 2.32. Acts 13.47. And Christ said, <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Darkness rather then Light, because their Deeds were Evil; every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, &amp;c.</hi> John 3.19, 20. The Apostle said, <hi>All things that are reproved are made manifest by the Light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is Light,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God hath shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> The Life of God and Christ, which is the Light of Men, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, is the Light which we the People of God called <hi>Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And all that thou hast said and writ to the contrary against the Light and its Children for their Testimony to it▪ it all falls to the Ground, and thou art defeated, and thou haft lost the Day (take it in thy own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That thou hast not a Right Sense of God, and Sin, and Eternal Things, thou hast given large Proof in thy Books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is great plenty of Blasphemous Expressions against the Light, in which we have believed, and Lyes against us the Children of it, and Contradictions to thy self; in Blasphemous Words against the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, which is the Light the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe in, and preach for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, thou hast out-done all that ever I read before thee, and also in contradicting of thy self, and in telling Lyes of the People whom thou in Scorn callest <hi>Quakers,</hi> thou comest behind few: I have in a distinct Head summed up a few of thy many Lyes, by which the Reader may see, that thou art an Artist at that bad Trade. <hi>Roger Haydock</hi> hath collected and published some of thy Self-Contradictions, by which the Reader may see, what a <hi>Babylonish</hi>-Builder thou art.</p>
            <p>But seeing thou hast not a right Sense of God and Eternal Things, but art destracted, &amp;c. why dost thou take so boldly upon thee to judge the Life &amp; Light in which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have believed, to be <hi>Dagon, Diana, an Idol,</hi> &amp; compares it to a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Coach man, &amp;c. Herein thou hast shewed thy Destraction, and thy wrong Sense of God, and his Light and of his Children, who walk in the Light according to the Apostle's Doctrine, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> thou confessest in thy Book entituled, <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism Herefie, That God is Light, and Omni-present, and so both within man and without him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In this thou hast confessed Truth, which Confession of thine agrees with the Doctrine and Principle of the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> who say, the Life of God is the Light of Men, and is the true Light which lighteth every Man which cometh into the World; this Omni-Presence of God, who is Light in Man, is not <hi>Dagon, Diana, an Idol,</hi> nor is it like <hi>a drunken Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> here the Unprejudiced Reader may easily see thy Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cheyney</hi> saith in p. 13. <hi>We are sure we cannot be deceived, that there is not any thing at all in every Man, nor in any Man, that is nor can be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> J. C. This is a flat Contradiction to what thou saidst
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96767:7"/>before, who saidst, <hi>God is Light, and Omni-present, and so, both within Man and without him;</hi> here thy Distraction is largely manifested: But why shouldst thou be so confident, that thou canst not be deceived, seeing thou sayest, thou hast not a Right: Sense of God, but art distracted, &amp;c. It cannot reasonably be expected that thou (who as thou sayest, <hi>hast not a Right Sense of God, but art distracted,</hi> &amp;c) should be sure concerning any Heavenly and Spiritual Thing, thou who speakst such flat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions to thy self, art not like to speak Right Things of God who is a pure Fountain of Divine Light and Life, nor of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who believe in his <hi>Life,</hi> which is the <hi>Light</hi> of Men.</p>

            <p>Now thy Baseness and Disingenuity is manifest in thy arguing against this Light under those Names, which neither the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth nor we do give unto it.</p>
            <p>Thou callest it <hi>Conscience, a Natural Light;</hi> these are thy own Names which thou hast given unto the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, &amp; when thou hast given it such false Names, as might most suit thy malicious D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The holy Scriptures do not say as thou dost, but put a Distinction between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>soul of man:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> saith, <hi>Why art thou cast down, oh my Soul? why art thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me? trust thou in God,</hi> Psal 42.5, &amp; 6. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle prayed to God for the Saints, that <hi>their whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body might be preserved Blameless, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Thess. 5.23.</p>
            <p>Observe, <hi>J. C.</hi> the Apostle did not pray, that the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, might be preserved blameless; for that is everlastingly holy and blameless; and it is not possible that it can be otherwise, God being unchangeably holy.</p>
            <p>The Word of the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, all Souls are mine, as the Soul of the Father, so also the Soul of the Son is mine; but the Soul that sinneth, it shall Dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.4.</p>
            <p>Observe, <hi>J. C.</hi> it is possible that the Soul may Sin and Dye, as to God, through its Disobedience to or Rebellion against the Life or Spirit of God, which is the Light of Men. The Lord speaks by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> saying, <hi>Wo to the Rebellious Children, who take Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96767:8"/>it is possible for the Soul to sin, that turns from, rebels against, and ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ses the Life and Spirit of God for its Covering; but its impossible for the Life and Spirit of God to sin, or be guilty of any Sin.</p>
            <p>Gen. 2.7. <hi>The Lord God formed Man of the Dust of the Ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul:</hi> God's Life or Breath <hi>is God,</hi> by its In-breathing upon Man, Man became a living Soul: This living Soul, made by the Breathing of <hi>God, is not God,</hi> but is an Effect produced and brought forth by the Breath of God; this Soul is immortal, it cannot cease to be in some degree of Well or Wo, of Rest and Peace, or Sorrow or Trouble; and though the Soul under the Power of Sin is Dead as to God, and not being acted and governed by him, is not in Unity and Peace with him, yet it lives in a sense, but its in a sense of Deprivation of Unity and Peace with God and so in a sense of Disquiet and Trouble; and at this Christ pointed in the Parable concerning the Rich &amp; the Poor Man, the one in Heaven, and the other in Hell; as also its pointed at where the Prophet saith <hi>Tophet is prepared of old for the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, there is Fire and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord as a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it;</hi> and also, where Christ said, <hi>What will it advantage a man if he could gain the whole World and lose his own Soul?</hi> the Omnipresence of the Life and Breath of God upholds the Soul of Man in Immortality, being present with it.</p>

            <p>J. C. take notice of this, if thou desirest to have the Blood of Christ to cleanse thee from all Sin, thou must believe in the Light within, which convinceth thee of it, and reproveth thee for it, and if thou believe in it and walk therein, it will convince thee of all thy Hard and Blasphemous Speeches against God, who is Light, in whom is no Darkness at all; and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee of thy Envy, Lyes and Rage against his People; and it will lead thee to Repentance, and so to Remission of thy Sins, if thou believe in it and obeylit, and walk in it, as afore-said, while it strives with thee, while the Day of thy Visitation lasteth; for God who is Light and Spirit saith, <hi>My Spirit shall not alwayes strive with Man;</hi> so when his Light strives, his Spirit strives; for his Light and Spirit are one, of one Being, though in thy Darkness thou wouldst make them two.</p>
            <p>Christ saith, <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that follows me shall not walk in Darkness, but he shall have the Light of Life;</hi> —And he saith, <hi>Believe in the Light, that you may be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light;</hi> he is the same yesterday, to day and forever,

               <hi>J.C.</hi> I desire thou mayst believe this Testimony concerning the Light which is in Scripture Words, which will be for thy Eternal Good, and may be for the Good of those whose Minds thou hast darkned (by thy blasphemous Words and foolish Arguments) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Life of God, which is the Light of Men; for if thou believest this Testimony concerning the Light &amp; walkst therein, God who is Light will constrain thee publickly to condemn thy blasphemous Words, which thou hast uttered in print against it; and to seek to turn them to it, whose Hearts thou hast hardned against it. To prove thy Assertion, that <hi>The Light within is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> thou quotest Christ's Words, <hi>The Light of the Body is the Eye, if therefore thy Eye be single, thy whole Body shall be full of Light; but if thy Eye be evil, thy whole Body shall be full of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; if therefore the Light which is in thee be Darkness, how great is that Darkness?</hi> Mat. 6.22.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou mayst see upon what Occasion these words were spoken, by the fore-going verses, which are as follow, <hi>Lay not up for your selves Treasures upon Earth, where Moth and Rust doth corrupt, and where Thieves break through and steal, but lay up for your selves Treasures in Heaven, where neither Moth nor Rust doth corrupt, and where Thieves do not break through nor steal; for where your Treasure is, there will your Hearts be also,</hi> I say the Light and Spirit of God doth lead the Spirits and Minds of those that believe and walk therein, to set their Affections on things that are above, and to lay up their Treasures in Heaven, as Christ commands, and to be spiritually-minded, in which is Life and Peace, as saith the Apostle: Now they that do thus, their Eye is single and good, and so they are full of Heavenly Spiritual Light; this Eye will not offend, there is no need to pluck it out; but if People hate the Light, then they joyn unto Satan, who exerciseth their Spirits and Minds in Covetous Practices, in Envy and Malice, Idolatry, &amp;c. they set up their Idols in their Hearts, and are men of carnal Minds, in which is Death, as saith the Apostle; these have an Evil Eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in them by Satan, and this Eye looks after him (and his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96767:10"/>evil Treasures) that hath opened it; and he fills such with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with a Treasury of Envy and Malice, and Blasphemy, such as thou hast; so the Evil Man out of the Evil Treasury of his Heart brings forth Evil Things, as Christ hath said, and hath the Evil Eye that offends, which Eye thou hast, Christ's Command is, <hi>Pluck it out, and cast it from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Substance of the same Words before answered, are also in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.34, 35 thus, <hi>The Light of the Body is the Eye, therefore when thy Eye is single thy whole Body also is full of Light; but when thy Eye is Evil, thy whole Body also is full of Darkness; take heed therefore, that the Light which is in thee be not Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Occasion of these Words thou mayst also see, by the fore-going verses, which are as follow, ver. 29.—<hi>This is an Evil Generation, they seek a Sign, and there shall be no Sign given, but the Sign of</hi> Jonas <hi>the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. and he said further, <hi>The Queen of the South, &amp; the Men of</hi> Nineveh <hi>shall rise up in Judgment against this Generation; for the men of</hi> Nineveh <hi>repented at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of</hi> Jonah, but Christ who is greater then <hi>Jonah</hi> preached, and that evil Generation repented not at his preaching; <hi>The Queen of the South came from the utmost Parts of the Earth to hear the Wisdom of</hi> Solomon, <hi>and admired it, and said, the half had not been told her, and she honoured him for his Wisdom;</hi> but when Christ the Wisdom and Power of God (as the Apostle calls him) preacht un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Evil Generation, they did not admire his Wisdom and Power, neither did they honour him, but said, <hi>He had a Devil and was mad,</hi> and said, <hi>By Beelzebub the Prince of Devils he cast out Devils:</hi> And this Generation shewed their Love to <hi>Barabas,</hi> to get him out of Prison, who was committed to prison for Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Murder, and they cryed, <hi>Crucifie Jesus,</hi> and as the Martyr said, <hi>Of him they were the Betrayers and Murderers;</hi> so that Evil Generation loved their Brother <hi>Barabas</hi> (as Christ said, <hi>The World loves its own</hi>) and to his Disciples he said, <hi>I have chosen you out of the World, therefore doth the World hate you; it hated me before it hated you, and it hated me without a Cause, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Evil Generation, who hated Christ and his Disciples, and put him and them to Death, had an Evil Eye opened in them by Satan, who is a Murderer and a Lyar: So this Evil Eye, that he had opened in their Spirits, Minds, and Hearts, looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96767:10"/>his Work, which is Murder, and Blasphemy, and Lying; and so he filled them with Darkness, so they brought forth his Evil Treasure, that he had filled their Hearts withal; so this is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Eye that offends, which all must know pluckt out, and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that enter God's Kingdom; and as it is written in the Scriptures of Truth, <hi>Out of the Heart proceedeth an Evil Eye,</hi> Mark 7.22. The Apostle saith, <hi>But if our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this World hath blinded the Mind of them that believe not,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. Mark Reader, the Apostle saith, <hi>The god of the World hath blinded the Mind,</hi> he doth not say, that he hath blinded the Light within, or the Life of God, which is the Light of Men; the Apostle also saith to the Believers, <hi>Ye were sometimes Darkness but now are ye Light in the Lord, walk as Children of the Light,</hi> Ephes. 5.8. and when Christ appeared to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was going to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> he said to him, <hi>I send thee</hi> (to wit, <hi>to the</hi> Gentiles) <hi>to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> &amp;c. and he further saith in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.18. of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>they were darkned, and alienated FROM THE LIFE OF GOD,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> By all these Scriptures it doth plainly appear, that the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, is not Darkness; but that man, who is a Stranger from this Life, is Darkness, in whom the god of this world hath blinded his Mind. So whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reads with an Heavenly Understanding, thy Blasphemous Charge against the Light within, may see, that thou chargest that upon the Life of God, which is unchangeably pure, which is truly chargeable upon the DEVIL, and Fallen, Darkned, Rebellious Man (to wit, <hi>That it is Darkness</hi>) But as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle said, <hi>God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all, there is no Variableness, nor Shadow of Turning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

See <hi>Call to Prayer,</hi> p. 100. where thou sayest, <hi>We take not upon us to know any Man's Heart, but our own;</hi> and in page 99. also sayest, <hi>We cannot know their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>He that saith he is in the Light, and hateth his Brother, is in Darkness, even until now, and walketh in Darkness, and knows not whither he goes, because that Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96767:11"/>hath blinded his Eyes; but he that loveth his Brother abideth in the Light, and there is no Occasion of Stumbling in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.9 10, 11.</p>

               <hi>They who remove the Land-Marks, and violently take away Flocks, and take away the Ass of the Fatherless, and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's Ox, and pluck the Fatherless from the Breast, and cause the poor to go naked, and take the Sheaff from the hungry, these are they who rebel against the Light, they know not the Way thereof, nor abide in the Paths thereof,</hi> Job 24. from verse 2 to 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkness rather then Light, because their Deeds were evil; for every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds should be reproved; but he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. 3.19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Christ said of the Unbelievers, <hi>This Peoples Hearts are waxed gross, and their Ears are dull of hearing, and</hi> THEIR EYES THEY HAVE CLOSED, <hi>lest at any time they should see with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and should understand with their Hearts, and they should be converted, and I should heal them;</hi> but to the Believers he said, <hi>Blessed are YOƲR EYES; for THEY SEE, and your Ears; for they hear,</hi> Mat. 12.15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> by all these Scriptures cited, It doth appear, that they who do wickedly hate the Light, and rebel against it, and do not abide in the Path thereof; but they love Darkness, and do choose to walk therein; and they do close their Eyes, lest they should see with their Eyes and understand with their Hearts, and be converted, &amp;c. Thus it plainly appears, that the Light within is not to be blamed, nor charged with their Rebellion, it being clear from all their Sins, it never Consenting unto any Sin, but condemns for it; the Light is the same in its Kind and Nature in him who hates it, and in him who loves it, (to wit, pure and holy) therefore it condemns the Unholy, who rebel against it.</p>
            <p>But thou art justly blameable, and greatly condemnable, who hast charged the Light within with being <hi>guilty of the Sins of all the Damned in Hell;</hi> thou sayest, <hi>There is not, nor ever was, nor

The Apostle said unto the Saints, <hi>For ye were sometimes</hi> DARKNESS, <hi>but now are ye</hi> LIGHT IN THE LORD, <hi>walk as Children of the Light: For the Fruits of the Spirit is in all Goodness, Righteousness and Truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, and have no Fellowship with the unfruitful Works of</hi> DARKNESS, <hi>but rather reprove them</hi> Ephes. 5.8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Mark, <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> Here the Apostle saith, Walk in the Light, that ye may be the Children of the Light, for the Fruits of the Spirit is in all Goodness, &amp;c. Here the Apostle joyns the Light and the Spirit of God together, which indeed are one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96767:12"/>in Nature: For God is a Spirit, and he is Light, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures say; and his Manifestation in man is Spirit and Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If ye walk in the Spirit</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>ye shall not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> Gal. 3.16.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>If we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, then have we Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son clenseth us from all Sin,</hi> 1 John 5.7.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> who was with our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ when he was Transfigured in the holy Mount, heard a Voice from the Excellent Glory, saying, <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him;</hi> afterwards <hi>Peter</hi> truly related or declared unto the Believers in Christ what he had heard, and when he had so done, he said, <hi>We have also a More Sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we do well that ye take heed, as unto a Light that shines in a</hi> DARK PL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mark, <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> Here the Apostle directed to take heed unto the Word of Prophecy, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark place, until the Day did dawn, and the Day-Star did arise in their Hearts; and this he said was more sure unto them then that which he had heard, and truly declared unto them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>God said, That <hi>the Wicked hated Knowledge, and did not choose the Fear of the Lord; they would have none of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; they despised all my Reproof; therefore shall they eat of the Fruit of their own Wayes, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 1.29, 30.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>J. C.</hi> by these Scriptures it doth plainly appear, that the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, is wholely clear from Sin, God thereby tendring Counsel and Reproof unto Wicked Men, and they despising and refusing all his Counsel, and would have none of his Reproof, THEMSELVES are guilty of their Sins, but the Light is clean and spotless forever. They who say to God, <hi>Depart from us, we desire not the Knowledge of thy Wayes,</hi> though these be filled with Sin, and perish therein, God, his Life and Spirit, which is the Light of Men, is clear from all their Wickedness, and their Destruction is of themselves.</p>
            <p>Christ said unto his Disciples, who had believed in him, the true Light, and abode in him, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World, a City set on a Hill that cannot be hid; neither do men light a Candle and put it under a Bushel, but on a Candlestick, that is may give light unto all that are in the House: Let your Light so shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men that they may see your Good Works, and glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Mark, <hi>J. C.</hi> Christ's Command to his Disciples, Let your Light so shine as the Candle shines upon the Candlestick, which gives light to all that are in the House; and so those did who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Light, <hi>who brought their Deeds to the Light, that they might be made manifest they were wrought in God; But every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, and will not bring their Deeds to the Light, lest they should be Reproved.</hi> So the Light of Life doth not shine forth in their Conversation before Men, as the Candle doth shine upon the Candlestick, but the Light of Life in them is vailed, by and with their Evil Conversation, which the Power of Darkness leadeth them into; yet it is the same Light in its Nature and Kind in them who hate it and in them who love it; in the one it shines as the Candle upon the Candlestick, in the other it shines in Darkness, as the Apostle saith: and so it shines as if a lighted Candle should be put under a Bushel. Now if a lighted Candle were put under a Bushel, there would be Light under that Bushel, even the same in KIND as if it were set upon a Candlestick; even so there is Light in the Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96767:13"/>who hates it; and though it doth not appear in his Evil Conversation, yet it reproves him for Evil; and because he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his Evil Deeds, he hates it, and therefore it is his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>The Lord God, who is Light, who lighteth every one that cometh into the World with a pure spiritual Light, he hath made the <hi>natural light</hi> to give light unto all the Inhabitants of the Earth; it shines upon the Dunghil, as well as upon the pleasant Valley; the Dunghil hath not Power to take away or change the pure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Sun, neither hath the Devil or Wicked men power to take away or change the pure Property and Nature of the Life of God, which is the Light of Men.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>natural Sun</hi> is divers times vailed from our natural Sight or Eye, by and with Clouds of outward natural Darkness; but the Outward Darkness doth not convert and change the <hi>light of the Sun</hi> into Darkness, but it remains in its own nature <hi>(light)</hi> shining in or under the Darkness, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its Strength expels and scatters the Darkness, and shines in its Clearness when the Darkness is gone and past.</p>
            <p>The Life of God, which is the Light or spiritual Sun, shines upon the Hearts and Souls of all Men and Women; some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, some believe not in it; those who believe in it, it scatters &amp; drives away the Clouds of Ignorance, which have been drawn over the Souls by the god of the World, who hath blinded the Mind; and such can say as the Apostle <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>The Darkness is past;</hi> and as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said to the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Light, <hi>Ye are all Children of the Light and of the Day, ye are not of the Night nor of Darkness; spend not your Time in Chambering and Wantonness, but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof:</hi> But those who hate the Light, are more and more filled with Darkness, and grow worse and worse, and are given up to work Wickedness with Greediness; yet these Haters of the Light cannot change the Light into Darkness, nor alter nor change the pure Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, nor make it Partaker with them in their Sins; but it remains a faithful Witness against Sin, and the Devil, who is the Author of it.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96767:14"/>
            <p>In Vindication of the Life of God, which is the Light of men, I further argue; <hi>God is above all, the highest, or the most high, there is nothing above him to be his Life, and there is nothing below him that can be his Life; therefore the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, which Life is Omni-present, is God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. John Cheyney,</hi> thou sayst, as afore-said, that <hi>God is Light, and Omni-present, and so both within Man and without him,</hi> which is true; God is not divided into Parts, Pieces and Shreds, as thou darkly and wickedly talkest; and wouldst insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> so hold and believe concerning him: But we say, he is indivisable, in his own Being or Essence, and his being in all Mankind doth no wayes scripturally or reasonably prove, that he is divided into Parts, &amp;c. a thou foolishly arguest; for though God be indivisable in his own Being, who is an infinite Spirit, yet he measurably manifests himself in and to Mankind according to his Heavenly Will, &amp; the several Capacities of Men &amp; Women. And what I say herein, is agreeable to Scripture; The Apostle saith, <hi>There is one God over all, through all and in you all;</hi> and he said, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me;</hi> and if Christ lived in him, did not God live in him? And the Apostle preacht the Mystery that had been hid from Ages and Generations, <hi>Christ in them their Hope of Glory;</hi> wilt thou therefore say, that the Apostle and all the Saints, in whom Christ was revealed, were
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96767:14"/>all Gods, and to be worshipped as Gods? Oh! what Confusion Distraction and Madness hath thy Pride and Envy brought thee into? Oh! that thou mightst find a place of Unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it would be my Rejoycing, for my own sake, and for the sake of others whom thou hast greatly abus'd, in leading them to believe thy Blasphemy &amp; Darkness utter'd against God who is Light, and thy Lyes and Envy against his People. But thy arguing against what thou hast confest to (which is Truth) as afore cited, is both Unscriptural and Unreasonable; for it doth not follow, because God is measurably manifest in men, or in all men, that therefore Man is God; and that when Man dyes, God dyes; and that when a Child is born, a God is born; and that so many Men as there are, so many Gods there are: nor that Man is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or to be worshipped as God, &amp;c. Herein thou hast ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested such a piece of Distraction and spiritual Madness, as I never saw with my Eyes nor beard with my Ears before.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here thou grants God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit to be above the Scriptures, it is well thou hast confessed to Truth in this matter, this is according to our Doctrine which thou quote in the Book entituled, <hi>Quakerism Subverted,</hi> p. 6. Our Doctrine is as followeth, <hi>The only Way for People to come to a true Sight of sincere Respect for, and grounded Belief in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, is to be turned to the Voice of the Living, Powerful Word of God from whom they came, which is nigh unto every one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96767:17"/>to direct and order, and discipline to and in that Way of Holiness they testifie of, and which leads to Eternal Happiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in p. 244. J. C. saith, <hi>To the Spiritual, Holy and Saving Belief and Ʋnderstanding of the Scriptures, there is requisite and necessary the Special Illumination and Ʋnction of God's Spirit.</hi> And further he saith in the same page, <hi>There needs no living Judge for the deciding of Controversits, besides the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> J. C. here thou hast largely confessed unto the special Illumination and Unction of God's Spirit to the spiritual, holy and saving Belief and Understanding of the Scriptures: Now on this thy own Principle, thou and all the Men of thy Way, must of Necessity come to the Spirit of God, and receive its Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination and Unction, before you can come to the spiritual, holy and saving Belief and Understanding of the Scriptures; and to this Spirit of God you must come that it may end your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about Scriptures and their Meaning, about which you are on Heaps amongst your selves; and to this Spirit you must come to end your Controversies in all things which relate to God's Worship. Now this living Spirit, or Life of God, which is the Light of Men, being that from which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures proceeded, and which must give the saving Belief and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them, this must needs be (as thou hast well affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) above the Scriptures; and without first coming to this, according to thy own confession, Van cannot come to the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, holy and saving Belief and Knowledge of the Scriptures; and if they cannot without this, then without this the Scriptures cannot be helpful to Man's Salvation; this follows clearly upon thy own before cited Principle, so herein thou hast in plain Words affirmed as much as the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do in this particular. I could desire thou wouldst be true to this thy own Affirmation.</p>
               <p>J. C. take notice, that though the Scriptures, as thou hast granted, cannot be helpful to Man's Salvation without the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Illumination &amp; Unction of the Spirit, yet the Life of God, or the living Spirit can help Man, and give Salvation to him, who hath not the Scriptures, and this is proved in <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, &amp;c.</hi> who all received God's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before the Scriptures were written; and <hi>Moses</hi> that Man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96767:17"/>of God, received Salvation from God, before he writ or gave forth the Law; and all the Holy Men, who gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, received Salvation from God before they writ or gave forth the Scriptures, as the Holy Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>The Scriptures came not in old time by the Will of Man, but Holy Men of God gave them forth as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, (Living Spirit or Life)</hi> J. C. here take notice, that not only the Life of God, or Living Spirit did precede, and was before the Scriptures, but also the Holy Men did precede, and were before the Holy Scriptures: The Living <hi>Spirit</hi> or Life of God is the same to day, yesterday and forever; this hath opened the Scriptures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and made them profitable and comfortable unto us, as I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We do not cast them off, but do believe, read and love them, and have Comfort in them, and have profit by them (as I have said before) being come to the Life and Spirit of God from whence they did proceed (through the Holy Men) which Life and Spirit opens them unto us; for that is the <hi>ONLY KEY</hi> to open them; the Scriptures do treat of the deep things of God; and as the Holy Apostle saith, <hi>The things of God knows no Man, but the Spirit of God, and it searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God:</hi> And <hi>WHY</hi> the Life or Spirit of God (which is the Light of Men must be prefered above the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, thou hast given thy <hi>SELF AND THE MEN</hi> of thy way a very strong convincing Reason, Namely, in that thou hast affirmed, <hi>That the Scriptures are not God, Christ, nor the Spirit, but Laws, Doctrines Histories and Reports given by Inspiration of God;</hi> and thou acknowledgest, <hi>God, Christ and the Spirit to be above them;</hi> and thou sayest, <hi>To the Spiritual, Holy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Belief and Ʋnderstanding of the Scriptures, there is Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the special ILLƲMINATION AND ƲNCTION of God's Spirit,</hi> see thy <hi>Sermons of Hypocrisie.</hi> p. 243, 244 Here thou hast fully answered thy own Question, and also thou hast confuted and overthrown thy twenty Arguments, against the Life or Spirit of God, which is the Light of (and in) Men</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ</hi> In this thou sayest well, in this thou grants, that God's writing his Law upon the Heart <hi>Is the Choicest Mercy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Soul,</hi> therein thou set'st up and preferest the Inward Writing and the Writer, above the Outward Writing, and Man the Outward Writer; this is according to God's Promise, who said, <hi>I will make a New Covenant with the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>I will write my Law in their Hearts, they shall not need to teach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96767:18"/>Man his Brother, saying, know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the greatest of them unto the least of them.</hi> And the Apostle who was a Minister of this New Covenant or Testament said, <hi>God hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament, not of THE LETTER, but of the Spirit;</hi> and he said, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath set me free from the Law of Sin and Death:</hi> and the Apostle's preaching up the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the Law in the Heart, did not destroy, or cast off, and make useless the Ten Commandments, &amp; Law of God written in Tables of Stone and Books; neither doth our preaching up the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, and calling upon People to be subject to the Law thereof, which it writes upon the Heart, make us to cast off the Scriptures, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, nor any Command or Precept which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; But in our receiving and preaching of the New Covenant <hi>WITHIN</hi> we see the fulfilling and ending of the Shadowy Part of the Old, as Circumcision, the Blood of Bulls and Goats and the rest of the Shadows, Carnal and Outward Offerings, which, though they were truly Commands of God, instituted for a time, appointed by him yet these did pass away and were ended, by Christ, who is the one Offering, who hath offered up himself through the Eternal Spirit above sixteen hundred Years ago: And the Ten Commandments, and all Commands, Precepts and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contained in the Holy Scriptures, which require Love and Obedience to God and Christ, and Love, Justice, Equity and Mercy towards Men <hi>WE DEARLY OWN,</hi> and the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ which we have received, strengthens and enables us to love God with our whole Hearts, even all who abide in it, and grow up therein, and to love our Neighbours as our selves, not to cover that which is not ours; and magnified be the Lord, who hath shewed Mercy to us, in sending his dear Son—to bless us, in turning us from our Iniquities, for of our selves we can do nothing that is good) as saith the Holy Apostle; but he said,<note place="margin">Acts 3.26.

                  <hi>I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me,</hi> and Christ said unto his Disciples, <hi>I am the Vine, ye art the Branches, as the Branches cannot bring forth Fruit except they abide in the Vine, NO MORE can ye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>Whatsoever it is that God shall make known to be our Duty, we must do it, whether it be by Scripture or any other Way; — It had been a Duty to fear God, though Scripture had never said it;—It had been sin to steal, murder and commit Ʋncleanness, though God had never given forth his Precepts at Mount</hi> Sinai: And thou further sayest, <hi>Christ doth stamp and impress his divine and sacred Laws upon mens Hearts, and doth sweetly and most powerfully constrain all Saints to live after those Laws.</hi> And in p. 29. thou sayest, <hi>It's not the Office of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Spirit; the Spirit of God ONLY can open the Eyes of our Minds to understand the Scriptures;</hi> See <hi>Quak.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In this thou hast spoken Truth to thy own Confutation; for thou here grants, that God may make some Duty known unto man without the Scripture, and this Duty made known to Man without the Scripture thou sayest, <hi>We must do it</hi> (well said <hi>John Cheyney</hi>) then it's plain, the Scripture is not the chiefest or principal Rule for Man, in the Duty which God makes known unto him without the Scriptures;—But the Life or Spirit of God, which is the Light of Men, that makes some Duty known without the Scriptures; therefore it is the Principal or Chiefest Rule unto those Duties. <hi>The things of God knows NO MAN, but the Spirit of God; but this Spirit searcheth all Things, yea the Deep Things of God:</hi> thou hast affirmed (as I have shewed before) <hi>That to the spiritual, Holy and Saving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Ʋnderstanding of the Scriptures there is requisite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary the sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So by thy own Affirmation, the Scriptures cannot be savingly known, and so cannot be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental towards Man's Salvation without the special Illumination (or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96767:19"/>Scriptures, and so that Man, who hath Salvation, and hath not the Scriptures, he hath Salvation without the Scriptures, and so the Scriptures are not his Rule for his Salvation, but the Life or Spirit of God, which doth enlighten him to know his Duty, and strengthens him to do his Duty, that is the Rule of, and for his Salvation; and of this I have given clear proof before in the Case of <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, &amp;c.</hi> who all had Salvation before the Scriptures were written. And <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the holy Prophets and Apostles, who gave forth the Scriptures, they had Salvation given unto them by the Life or Spirit of God before they gave forth the Scriptures; so the Life of God, which gave them Salvation, was the Principal Rule of, and for their Salvation, and not the Scripture, which they gave forth after they had received Salvation.</p>
               <p>Thou sayest, <hi>It had been a Duty to Fear God, though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures had never said it.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (Well said, <hi>John Cheyney</hi>) this is still in Honour to the Life of God, which lighteth every one that cometh into the World; for this Life shewed Man, that it was his Duty to fear God, before the Scriptures were written; and this Life begot the Fear of God in Man; and this Life was his Rule and strength to keep him in the Fear of God.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96767:21"/>Stoning, Imprisoning some till Death, and (that) for no other Cause but for Worshipping God in his own pure Spirit, and with holding our own Corn, Hay, Cattle and Fleece from you Priests, who have set up a Trade of Preaching in your own Wills, for your own Earthly Ends; Christ hath not sent you; you do not abide in his Doctrine and Command, who said to his Ministers, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give:</hi> And his Ministers of old did and now do abide in his Doctrine, and keep this his Command.</p>
               <p>If any Man could hate you for Holiness, if the Hatred of that Man be but equal or proportionable to your Holiness, who can reasonably judge that such a Man (if any such there be) has much Hatred against you, seeing that Holiness is so very scarce amongst you, as by your own daily Confessions and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do largely appear. But as for us, we hate you not; and as for Holiness, we would be very glad that you were, or yet might be Holy. Indeed it is true (as it is written) <hi>Holiness becomes the Lord's House forever.</hi> And the Apostle said to the Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, <hi>The Temple of God is Holy, which Temple ye are.</hi> But your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversations, as well as Confessions, do prove that you are Unholy; you say, <hi>You are all poluted from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot; and that you leave undone that which you ought to do, and do that which you ought not to do; and that you have no Health in you:</hi> And some of you Priests say, <hi>That you Sin in your Most Holy Duties, &amp;c.</hi> This being all true which you say, there is no Cause for any Person to hate you for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, seeing you have it not: But we should be very glad to see you full of Holiness; for then we know that you would be full of Harmlesness, and that would be very good for your selves, and it would be good for your Neighbours; then you would cease to covet your Neighbours Goods, and spoiling, and casting inco Prison until Death for your Bellies, all which hath been practised by thy Brethren the Priests, and yet they continue in these Evil Works; therefore it is in vain for thee to boast of Holiness, while you have it not.</p>
               <p>How many Fatherless Children and Widdows dost thou think thy Brethren the Priests of <hi>England</hi> have made within 30 Years last past, by stifling Husbands and Fathers in Nasty Holes and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96767:22"/>Dungeons, because they could not (for the keeping of their Consciences void of Offence in the sight of God) conform to their Poluted Worship and Sacrifices, nor put into their Mouths? What Devouring have they made for their Bellies? Are not they Belly-gods, thinkest thou? What Plundering have they made for Tythes, which NOT CHRIST, but the Pope set up?

               <p>God and Christ is Love, and those who are the Ministers of the Everlasting Gospel, which is Glad-tidings to the sorrowful Soul, they dwell in the Love of God, and Christ, who is the Wisdom and Power of God; and in this Love, and Wisdom, and Power they gather People out of their sins, to God and Christ, their So Is Bishop, who feeds their Souls with his Flesh and Blood which comes down from Heaven, and gives them Life, and strengthens them day by day thereby to forsake and resist sin, and the Devil, who is the Author of it. Christ is Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, Priest, Prophet, Judge, Lawgiver and King in and over the Souls of his People; he leads them gently, and bears them in his glorious Arm of Power; he walls them about with his Strength; and keeps out him who would destroy their Souls; he nor his Servants, whom he sends to preach, do not covet any Man's Gold, Silver or Apparel, Cora, Hay or any earthly thing; neither doth Christ's Ministers Plunder, Spoil, Hate, Persecute, Cast into Prison for Hire or Wages; but <hi>ANTICHRIST's MINISTERS FALSLY CALL'D CHRIST's MINISTERS</hi> do all sorts of these bad Works: Yet all these sorts of Evil-Workers make their Boast of the Scriptures, and the most of them call them their <hi>Rule,</hi> as thou <hi>J.

The Scripture saith, <hi>He that uttereth a Slander is a Fool,</hi> Prov 10 18. <hi>John Cheyney</hi> hath uttered many Slanders against the People of God (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) a Catalogue of a few of them I have collected under a distinct Head in this Book, by which the unprejudiced Reader may see what a foolish man <hi>John Cheyney</hi> is, and how vain a thing it is for him to profess the Scriptures to be his Rule, while his Words and Deeds are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them; the express Command of the Lord God is, <hi>Thou shalt not raise a false Report, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 23.1. but <hi>John Cheyney</hi> hath raired many false Reports against the People of God (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) as I shall make appear plainly out of his four Books which I have now under Examination; therefore it is a vain thing for him to make his boast of the Scriptures being his Rule, and of his Love and Esteem unto them, while his Words and Deeds are absolutely contrary unto them; but in this his vain boasting he is like the Hypocrites of old (whom the Holy Apostle mentions) <hi>who made their boast of the Law, yet brake the Law, and therein dishonoured God,</hi> so hath <hi>John Cheyney</hi> done,

               <p>J.

               </p>
               <p>Reader, seriously consider how grosly and wickedly this J. C. wrests, the Scripture Words, cited in the afore-said Objection; Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches, as Branches cannot bring forth Fruit except they abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me; without me ye can do nothing:</hi> And he said, <hi>Except ye cat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> By this it appears, that Christ and his Disciples, which are his Church, are more nearly related one to the other, then <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> was; for it would be absurd to say, That without <hi>Jonathan David</hi> could do nothing, or without <hi>David Jonathan</hi> could do nothing; and it were false to say, <hi>David</hi> was the Vine, and <hi>Jonathan</hi> was the Branch or Branches; and it were false to say, that <hi>David</hi> eat <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Flesh, or that <hi>Jonathan</hi> eat <hi>David</hi>'s, or drunk his Blood; but it is true to say, the Saints eat Christs Flesh and drunk his Blood, which Flesh and Blood came down from Heaven, which never
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96767:25"/>saw Corruption; this is a Mystery hid from the Carnal Mind, that is Enmity against God. Hear <hi>John Cheyney</hi> further, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the aforesaid Objection, p 17. 2dly, <hi>Subjectively, and Inherently, and so Christ dwells by heavenly Light in the Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by heavenly Graces, and holy Habits and Disposi ions in the Heart; but,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn Cheyney, these are no more God and Christ himself, then the Soul it self, or then the Body it self, or any other Effect; they are but noble Effects of God and Christ upon the Soul, but in no wise to be accounted God and Christ.</hi> Hear him further in the same page, <hi>God's Essence is Ʋnconfinite (that is his Being) he fills Heaven and Earth, his Essence (or Being) is no more in one Place then in another.</hi> Reader, didst thou ever hear such a piece of Confusion as this? he saith, Christ dwells in the Understanding and in the Heart, and then affirms within three lines after, that this is no more God, &amp; Christ then the Soul it self, or, then the Body it self, or any other Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Reader, It, true what he hath said, <hi>That Christ dwells in the Heart and Ʋnderstanding of the Saints;</hi> but its false to say, <hi>That the Soul it self, or Body it self (of every man, or of any man) or any other Effect, is as much God or Christ as God and Christ is;</hi> this is horrible Blasphemy; this would make the Soul and Body of every man, or any man, to be God and Christ it self, and every Effect to be God and Christ it self: This is a piece of self-conceited <hi>John Cheyney</hi>'s Distracted Divining; and this his before said Doctrine brings that upon his own Head which he has falsly suggested against us, to wit, That every man is a God, Christ, &amp;c. But this Cursed Doctrine is abhorred by us; for, <hi>To us there is but One God, and his Name is One; he is an infinite Spirit, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, or present every where; he is everlastingly pure, without Mutation;</hi> he saith, <hi>I the Lord change not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, <hi>J. Cheyney</hi> saith, as is before cited, <hi>That God's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence (or Being) is unconfinite; he fills Heaven and Earth; his Essence</hi> (that is, his being) <hi>is no more in one place then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> He also saith in pag. 13. of the same Book, <hi>That we are sure, that there is not any thing at all in every man, no nor in any man, that is or can be God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, take notice, in the former of these J. C. confesses to God's Omnipresence, or his being every where; this is truth:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96767:25"/>he also saith, <hi>God is no more in one place then in another</hi> — in the latter he saith, <hi>We are sure that there is not any thing in every man, no nor in any man, that is or can be God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall not charge J. C. to be Atheistical in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; but sure I am, that his Principle afore cited is Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical, and therefore <hi>J. C.</hi> an <hi>Atheist</hi> in Principle; an <hi>Atheist</hi> is one that doth deny that there is a God; against such the holy Man testifieth thus, <hi>The Fool hath said in his Heart, There is no God.</hi> J. C. saith, <hi>That God's Essence (or Being) which Essence or Being</hi> IS GOD, <hi>is no more in one place then in another:</hi> And J. C. also saith, <hi>That he is sure, that there is not any thing in every man, no nor in any man, that is or can be God.</hi> So then upon his own Principle it follows, that God is no where, and so that there is No God at all. Oh horrible Darkness and Blasphemy!</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I. C.</hi> thou hast slandered us, as I have said before, in saying, <hi>We wrest, or rather take down the Scriptures.</hi>

                  <hi>I.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96767:26"/>and break, them as many of thy Brethren the Priests have done, &amp; it is notoriously manifest, that you Priests do greatly wrest he Scriptures in your preachings and writings, holding up the Shaddows, which Christ put an End to, and opposing Christ the Light, Life and Substance, which is the End of them; pleading for Tythes and great sums of Money for preaching, and for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, all which Christ &amp; the Apostles witnessed against.</p>
               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>The second Pillar, on which</hi> Quakerism <hi>is built, is</hi> Enthusiasm, <hi>or a Pretence to Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We do own Revelation, which the Word <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> (taken in the true and proper Sense) doth signifie; we say, as Christ saith, <hi>No man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</hi> see Mat. 11.27. &amp; Luke 10.22. And the Apostle who said, <hi>When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me, &amp;c.</hi> He knew God and Christ by Revelation; and when <hi>Peter</hi> said unto his Master, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> Christ said, <hi>Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father, &amp;c.</hi> see <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>But I certifie you, Brethren, that the Gospel that was preached by me is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> see Gal. 1.11, 12. Take notice J. C. that the Apostles knew God and Christ, and received their Gospel by Revelation: The Apostle saith, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath</hi> REVEALED <hi>them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. And Jesus said, <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wife and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes,</hi> see Mat. 11.25. Take notice J. C. that by Revelation the Babes come to know more of God and his Secrets, then the Earthly Wise and Prudent, who deny Revelation; and the Babes know more then thou dost, who hatest the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, and callest it <hi>Dagon and Dianna,</hi> and mockst at Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Apostle saith concerning prophesying and speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Things of God, <hi>If any thing be</hi> REVEALED <hi>to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace, &amp;c. for you may all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96767:26"/>one by one, &amp;c.</hi> see 1 Cor. 14.30, 31. Take notice J. C. the Apostles received the Gospel by Revelation, and if any thing was REVEALED to another that sate by, the first was to hold his peace; by this it plainly appears, that they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own Revelation, but they waited for it in their prophesying and ministring unto the People: And we the People of God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> have received our Gospel by Revelation, and do own and wait for Revelation, and speak forth for the Good of Peoples Immortal Souls, that which God by his Spirit reveals unto us; but it appears you Priests, who deny Revelation, and mock at it, have not received that which you call Gospel, by Revelation, neither do wait for Revelation, and that is the Cause you are in such Heaps, and Confusion amongst your selves concerning God, Christ, Scriptures, Principles, Doctrines, Faith, Election and Reprobation, &amp;c. and that is the Reason you are so full of Wrath &amp; Malice against them that have received their Gospel by Revelation, who preach freely, without Money or Price, in whom is fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who said, <hi>He every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, AND HE THAT HATH NO MONEY COME ye buy and eat, yea come buy Wine and Milk WITHOƲT MONEY and WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OƲT PRICE,</hi> see Isa. 55.1. and the Apostle said, <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded God shall</hi> REVEAL <hi>even this unto you,</hi> see Phil. 3.15. J. C. here take notice, that the Apostle doth highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of REVELATION, saying, if any was otherwise minded (or contrary minded) to him and the rest, who were of a right and sound Mind in the things of God, that God should reveal the same unto them, that he had revealed to the Apostle and the rest, that were of a sound Mind; here the Apostle placeth the giving and receiving of a right Understanding and a sound Mind in the things of God, upon REVELATION; thus much in short concerning Revelation; and if thou callst this one of our Pillars, thou and all <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>'s great Army can never throw it down. But J. C. when dost thou think that you Priests of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will go forth with such a Proclaimation as <hi>Isaiah</hi> did? when will you have good Wine and Milk to deliver to the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money, or without Price? many would be glad to see you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96767:27"/>furnished with Milk and Wine as the Holy Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were; this would be good for your selves and the People, who have hitherto spent their Money upon you for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that, which hath <hi>NOT</hi> brought <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>The third Pillar, on which</hi> Quakerism <hi>stands, is Worldly-Pollicy; Worldly-Pollicy is their Square and Moddal, and they bend and crooken Religion all they can to make them thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In this thou wickedly slanderest the People (by thee in Scorn) called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for it is not unknown to many in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that this People since God raised them up to worship him in Spirit and Truth (according to Christ's Doctrine &amp; Command) have undergone great Sufferings, in the Spoyl of their Goods, and Imprisonment of their Bodies, and beating and bruising ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny until death in <hi>O. Cromwel</hi>'s Dayes, as may appear in several Books and Papers anciently written and printed; and since the Kings Return into <hi>England,</hi> there have dyed Prisoners in several Goals in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> for the Testimony of Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, above two hundred Persons, as may be seen in a Book lately printed, entituled, <hi>The Continued Cry of the Oppressed for Justice,</hi> and in the said Book, and others printed since the King's Return to <hi>England,</hi> it doth appear, that the said People have suffered great spoyl and loss of Goods, divers till it came to their wearing-Clothes, working-Tools, Food which they were ready to eat, and the Instruments in which they dressed their Food; divers who did abound in plenty of Food and Raiment, and were helpful to the poor of the Parishes, and Precincts where they did live, had not a Bed lest to lie down upon; some were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to go abroad to get lodging, and to borrow Beds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Necessaries of their Friends &amp; Neighbours till they could be otherwise provided for. J. C. I would have thee to read the before cited Book of Sufferings, which when thou hast read, it may be thou mayest be sorry, that thou hast thus wronged the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in this particular at least; see <hi>Cambridge</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, p 9, 10. <hi>Norfolk</hi> Sufferings in the same page, see <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> Sufferings, in p. 7. Note J. C. these Sufferings cited in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96767:27"/>pages, are but a Breviate of the Sufferings of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in the said Counties; but thou mayest read them more at large in the Second Part of the aforesaid Book; thou mayest also take notice, that divers of the People of God called <hi>Quakers</hi> have been banished out of the Land of their Nativity (<hi>ONLY</hi> for meeting together to worship God in Spirit &amp; Truth.</p>
               <p>J. C. by what I have here writ, and the Constancy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in and under their former and present great Sufferings, doth plainly demonstrate, that <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Pollicy</hi> is <hi>NO Pillar,</hi> upon which <hi>Quakerism</hi> is <hi>BƲILT;</hi> and therefore in this, as also in many other things, thou hast greatly abused and wronged them, and thou hast wofully missed thy Mark in this thy Charge against us; for it is thy Brethren the Priests, who make <hi>Worldly-Pollicy</hi> a Pillar of their <hi>RELIGION,</hi> who first preached up the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and took Money and Tythes for so doing, and afterwards preached down <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and took Money and Tythes for so doing; and then preached up the <hi>Presbyterian Directory,</hi> and sware, or covenanted to maintain the same, and took Money for so doing; and what! dost thou know none of these Men that have broken their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and now preach up the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? if thou knowest none such, it is possible that there may be diverss such found in <hi>England;</hi> hast thou never heard how thy Brethren the Priests did petition <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> and <hi>R. Cromwel</hi> and called them their <hi>Moses</hi> and their <hi>Joshua,</hi> and <hi>The Light of their Eyes,</hi> and <hi>The Breath of their Nostrils?</hi> if thou knowst none of these things, yet they are well known to many in <hi>England.</hi> J.C. thou art but a young man in thy way of preaching, and thou being on that Part which hath the Outward Power on its Side, <hi>Worldly-Pollicy</hi> will not (it is to be expected) lead thee to forsake thy Religion; but if thou shouldst see great Sufferings come upon those who profess thy Religion, and another appear instead thereof, in which outward Safety, the Friendship of the World, Earthly Honour and Riches were presented, then thou wouldst be tryed, and it is not unpossible, but thou mightst do as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy Elder Brethren have done.</p>
               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>The Fourth Pillar, on which</hi> Quakerism <hi>is built, is Monkish Holiness.</hi>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:96767:28"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord, as it is written in the holy Scriptures; and the holy Apostle said unto the Saints, <hi>The Temple of God is Holy, which Temple YE ARE;</hi> &amp; the Command of God was (and is) unto his People, <hi>Be ye Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I the Lord your God am Holy;</hi> this Holiness we love and dearly own, and we do wait upon God dayly to be filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with more and more to his Glory and Honour, and our Joy and Comfort.—But that which thou callst <hi>Monkish Holiness</hi> we do deny; it is amongst thy own Generation, it is too near thy self, a thy Feigned Shew of Humility, and Hypocritical Prayers and Sermons do shew unto those, who in the Fear of God, without any Hatred to thee, have taken Notice of thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> thou sayest, <hi>The Fifth Pillar on which</hi> Quakerism <hi>is built, is, Self-conceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a great Slander; for I do affirm on the Behalf of that Abused People, that it is their absolute constant Belief, that none of them can do any thing that is well-pleasing to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of themselves, or by their OWN POWER, NO NOT SO MUCH AS TO THINK A GOOD THOUGHT: And of this Belief were the ancient <hi>Christians</hi> as the holy Apostle said; but he said, <hi>I am able to do ALL THINGS through Christ that strengtheneth me;</hi> he said <hi>We are God's Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto Good Works, which God before ordained, that we should walk in them; and it is God that worketh all our Works in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. Cheyney,</hi> the Charge of <hi>Self conceit</hi> belongs to thy self, thou hast the greatest share of it of any that ever I read, that I know of: I am absolutely satisfied, if thou couldst be cured of that radicated, deep-rooted. evil Disease of Self-conceit, it would be a good step towards making thee a good <hi>Christian,</hi> that which at present thou art far from, as thy own Confession shews in thy Book entituled, <hi>A Call to Prayer,</hi> where thou sayest, <hi>Thou art constrained to pray Hypocritically, Dissemble with God, and to utter Ʋntruths unto him, who delighteth not but in Ʋpright Lips.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>J.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96767:28"/>Sensuality, and Idleness, and Malignity, and Covetousness of many in the Ministry, and the Ʋnrefermedness of many called Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here thou hast given a black Charge against thy Church, which being true, we have good cause to separate from you, seeing the Command of the Lord was and is to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Come ye out from amongst them—be ye separate, and touch no Ʋnclean Thing, and I will receive you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters,</hi> saith the Lord God Almighty: And the Counsel of the Wise is, <hi>Go not with the Multitude to do Evil.</hi> But though you have given us just Occasion to separate from you, because of the before-mentioned Abominations, that reign amongst you, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and eminently in thy Brethren the Priests, yet your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness is not any Pillar upon which <hi>Quakerism</hi> is built; but the Foundation of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> and the whole Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that upholds it, is Christ Jesus, the Power and Wisdom of God, which is from Everlasting to Everlasting; against this Foundation the Gates of Hell can never prevail.</p>
               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>The Seventh and last Pillar that</hi> Quakerism <hi>is built upon, is, a Seared Conscience, forsaken of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a horrible Slander, proceeding from the Father of Lyes: The holy pure God, hath visited us with his Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring from on high; he hath opened and tendered our Hearts, which in times past were darkened and hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin, which did grow and prevail in and over us in the time of our Ignorance and Estrangedness from God; he hath purged our Hearts from an Evil Conscience, as he did the Hearts of the true Believers in the Apostles dayes. And since this great Work and Mercy of God we have been Witnesses of, it hath been our daily earnest Prayer and Cry to God, that he might keep us in that Openness and Tenderness of Heart and Conscience, into which he hath begotten us; for we cannot keep our selves by any Power of our own (as I have said before) and though our Tryals and Sufferings, which we have undergone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Men of this Generation, have been great, yet mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified be the Lord God in that he hath manifested his Strength in our Weakness, and thereby has born us up to this day, so that our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96767:29"/>Hearts and Consciences are kept tender, sensible and open in Love and Obedience unto himself, and in true Love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to our Enemies. If we had been (as thou sayest) <hi>men of Seared Consciences, Forsaken by God;</hi> then we should not have exposed our selves, some of us to Banishment, some of us to Death, some of us to more then Two Seven Years Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and many to the great Spoil and Havock of their Goods, and some their All, as I have briefly hinted before: But we should rather have been like the Atheists of old, and some now adayes, who have said, <hi>Let us Eat and Drink, to morrow we shall Dye;</hi> and so have been like the Fool, that saith, <hi>There is No God, that makes a Mock at Sin:</hi> but Glory to the Lord God, he hath preserved us out of these things by his Almighty Power: We know, <hi>Them that will Reign with Christ, must Suffer with him; they that will live God-like in Christ Jesus, must suffer Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and <hi>he that is born after the Flesh, persecutes him that is born after the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>J. C. What dost thou think of thy Brethren, the Priests of <hi>England,</hi> who have first preached up <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and then preached it down again; and preached up the <hi>Directory,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted or sworn to uphold it, and since that have broken their Covenant, and preached down the <hi>Directory</hi> again, and up the <hi>Common-Prayer?</hi> Dost thou think these men are men of Tender Consciences? or are they not rather in a Degree <hi>Seared</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, &amp;c? And what dost thou think of thy Brethren, the Priests and <hi>Protestant</hi>-Professors esteemed of the purest Sort in <hi>New-England,</hi> who have made Laws to put the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> to Death, and put FOUR of them to Death (as I have said before) for no other Cause but the Exercise of their Tender Consciences towards God, in Worshipping him in Spirit and in Truth? Dost thou not believe these mens Consciences are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seared? And what dost thou think of thy Brethren the Priests, that have cast many of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> into Prison (until Death) and so have made Widows and Fatherless Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) because they would not give them Tythes, which thing Christ never commanded, nor gave Example or President for? dost thou think it is not an Unreasonable thing for thy Brethren
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96767:29"/>the Priests, <hi>to Demand and Force Wages from them for whom they do no Work, and to take Thrice, Four, or sometimes Six times as much as they have demanded to be their Dae?</hi> Dost thou not think that they are Unreasonable Men, and have Hard Hearts and Seared Consciences?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a notorious Slander, proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lyes; for we cause no Divisions in the Church, which is in God (the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ) which is made of Living Stones, Elect and precious: We worship God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh; our Praise is not of and from man, who is in Enmity against God; such a one thou art: we serve God, and our Lord Jesus Christ; &amp; he who feeds the Ravens &amp; clothes the Grass, he feeds &amp; clothes us, to whom be Everlasting Praise for all his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

               <p>Christ said in the dayes of his Flesh, <hi>Think ye I came to send Peace on Earth?

Again, saith he, <hi>Suppose ye that I am come to give Peace on Earth?

               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>We believe well of the Church for the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, we believe many lived and dyed in Peace with God in that time; we also believe, that God and Christ have had some faithful Witnesses through the several Ages of the World since, though in some Ages Few in Number, &amp; even as the Cleanings of the Vintage, or two or three Berries on a Tree top; for that which the Apostle</hi> John <hi>fore-saw &amp; testified of by Revelation about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years ago, that hath come to pass &amp; is in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree fulfilled.</hi> And there appeared a great Wonder in Heaven, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars; and she being with Child cryed, traveling in Birth, and pained to be delivered: And there appeared another Wonder in Heaven, and behold, a great red Dragon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96767:32"/>having seven Heads and ten Horns, and seven Crowns upon his Heads; and his Tayl drew the third Part of the Stars of Heaven, and did cast them to the Earth: and the Dragon stood before the Woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as it was born; and she brought forth a Man-Child, who was to rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron; and her Child was caught up unto God, and to his Throne; and the Woman fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where she hath a Place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore Dayes: And there was War in Heaven, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fought against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels, and prevailed not, neither was their Place found any more in Heaven, and the great Dragon was cast out that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the WHOLE WORLD, he was cast out into the Earth, and his Angels were cast out with him; and I heard a loud Voice saying in Heaven, now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Christ; for the Accuser of our Brethren is cast down, which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them before our God Day and Night; and they overcame him by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Testimony; and they loved not their Lives unto Death, <hi>Rev. 12. to the 12th ver.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We believe and are sure, that whomsoever the <hi>Papists</hi> have murdered, they have committed great Wickedness in so doing; it is a Breach of the Holy Law of God, who saith, <hi>Thou shalt do no Murder:</hi> But those that the <hi>Papists</hi> have murdered for their Faith and Obedience to God &amp; Christ, this is an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that cryes very loud in the Ears of the God of Righteous Judgment for Vengeance; and we believe, that many were put to death by them in <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s Dayes, not for Evil, but for the Exercise of their tender Consciences towards God; and that such, whose Consciences were tender towards God, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to what they THEN knew, and did rather chuse to dye, then to violate the Law of God in their tender Consciences, we believe they are everlastingly WELL; we believe the Testimony of the Holy Man, who said, <hi>That in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteousness is accepted of him.</hi> But J. C. if thou or any should say, these were not <hi>Quakers;</hi> that is more then you know, but if you mean, they were never called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of that you cannot be sure neither; but admit they were not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> we do not contend for the Name <hi>Quaker,</hi> that Name was first given us in Scorn, by a Magistrate in <hi>Derby shire,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Bennets;</hi> and if thou ask what Name we would have or own? we say, we are Christians, or the Servants of Christ, or Disciples (which is Learners) of Christ; and if thou object, that we are <hi>Quakers,</hi> because we have quaked, or do quake, or tremble, I answer, so did <hi>Moses, Habakkuk, David, Paul</hi> and the whole Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> as thou mayest read in the Scriptures of Truth.

The Lord said, <hi>Blow ye the Trum. pet in</hi> Zion, <hi>and found an Alarm in my Holy Mountain, let all the Inhabitants of the Land tremble; for the Day of the Lord co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> see Joel 2.1. <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> trembled, see his 3d chapter ver. 16. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and rejoyce with Trembling,</hi> Psal. 2.11. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He was amongst the Saints in Fear and much Trembling,</hi> 1 Cor 2.3. in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. the Apostle testifles, that the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> received a Brother <hi>with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>J. C. here thou mayest see, that the Prophets and Apostles, and People of God, both in the time of the Law and Gospel, did quake or tremble at his Presence and Commandment, as his People now do, which the Lord God taketh Pleasure in, as he saith by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit and</hi> TREMBLETH <hi>at my Word;</hi> therefore it is a great evil in thee or any other, to make a Mock at Quaking and Trembling at the Word of the Lord; it is the Will of the Lord, you should cease from so doing, and that you should quake or tremble at his Presence.</p>
               <p>J. C. in p. 158, 159. thou sayest, <hi>I challenge any Quaker to name me any one Church of Christ on Earth, which hath not been

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96767:35"/>call your Rule, seeing they do not live, preach and act according to them, but in many things absolutely the contrary, as I have shewed before; then is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Mother of your unscriptural vain Traditions before mentioned. <hi>John Baptist</hi> preacht Repentance to those he baptized, for the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins; when the wicked came to his Baptism, he said, <hi>Oh Generation of Vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the Wrath to come? bring therefore forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>I. C.</hi> by all these before cited Scriptures it doth appear, that the carnal Ordinances, (or Ordinances of the first Covenant) which were shadowy, are not to be imposed now upon, either <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>tentile,</hi> who believe in Christ the second Covenant, which doth make those who come to him (and obey him) perfect, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Conscience, which all carnal washings, eatings and drinkings fall short of; and it is apparent from the Scriptures before ctied, which relate to the Passeover, and Christ's keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or eating it with his Disciples, that he did it to fulfil the Law, who came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it, and end the shadowy Part thereof; for as the Apostle saith, <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that believeth,</hi> see Rom. 10.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> calls Christ, the Saints <hi>PASSEOVER,</hi> ver. 8. he saith, <hi>Therefore let us keep the Feast,</hi> NOT WITH OLD LEAVEN, <hi>neither with the Leaven of</hi> MALICE <hi>&amp;</hi> WICKEDNESS, <hi>but with the unleavened Bread of</hi> SINCERITY <hi>and</hi> TRUTH; thus it appears, that Christ is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96767:38"/>the Christians Passeover, who gives them his Flesh to eat, and his Blood to drink; so he is the Baptizer and Circumciser, and Feeder of his Church, which he hath purchased, and he is the Substance, and End of all the Shadows unto them. A Passeover is to be eaten; to this agrees the MYSTERIOUS SAYINGS of Christ to some, who were called his Disciples, who did eat of the outward Bread, and were filled, <hi>Ye seek me because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled, but except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood ye have no</hi> Life IN YOU; and when some took Offence at his Words and forsook him, he said, <hi>doth this offend you? what and if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before; it is the Spirit that quickens, the Flesh profiteth nothing; the Words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> John 6. read this chapter through.</p>
               <p>Here Christ shews, that it was not the Outward that he spoke of, but the Inward Spirit and Life. The <hi>Papists</hi> have greatly wrested and perverted these his words; they say, <hi>That the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bread and Wine, after Consecration, is the real Presence of Christ, or his Body and Blood.</hi> Here they make an Idol of the Creatures, being ignorant of the Creating Spirit and Life of Jesus; for, as the Apostle said, <hi>All things were created by him: (and for him) that are in Heaven &amp; that are in Earth, visible and invisible — And he is before all things, and by him all things consist,</hi> Col. 1.16, 17. And because the Ancient true <hi>Protestants</hi> could not bow to this their Idol, they put many of them to Death, the Cry of whose Innocent Blood hath sounded loud in the Ears of the God of Righteous Judgment, who certainly is a just Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all Murderers.</p>
               <p>Now, though the Ancient <hi>Protestants</hi> did oppose the <hi>Papists</hi> in their Idolatry (as aforesaid) for which many of them lost their Lives, yet it appears, those that did remain did continue the Custom of Eating Pread and Drinking Wine (which they had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to while they were amongst the <hi>Papists</hi>) not in the Gross Idolatrous Manner, us do the <hi>Papists,</hi> yet under a Vail, not so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing, nor so fully enjoying the Substance or Anti-tipe of the Passover or Supper, as the ancient grown <hi>Christians</hi> did in the Apostles dayes (which Passover or Supper Christ used according to the Custom of the Law) The Substance or Anti-tipe thereof is <hi>Christ within,</hi> whose Flesh is Meat, and whose Blood is Drink.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96767:38"/>So the Outward Passover (Bread and Wine) and the Pascal Lamb's Flesh and Blood under the Law were but Typical and Shadowy of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, which is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and spiritual, and of the New Wine of the Kingdom, all which Christ feeds his Church with.</p>
               <p>Now I understand the <hi>Protestants</hi> do place their Practice of eating Bread and drinking Wine, and calling it <hi>The Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> upon the words of Christ, mentioned in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. vers. 19. which words are these, <hi>This do in Remembrance of me.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> (repeating these before cited words of Christ) saith, <hi>As often as you eat this Bread and drink this Cup, you shew forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> Christ said, <hi>I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God,</hi> vers. 16. And he said, <hi>I will not drink of the Fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom of God shall come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> take notice, Christ said, He would eat no more until it was fulfilled in the Kingdom of God; he eat this Bread the fame Night he was betrayed, as saith the Apostle. Now, when he was offered up and crucified, who was the One Offering, as the Apostle saith, who perfects forever them that are sanctified, then was the Shadowy Dispensation the Passover, with the rest of the Shadows ended, as not being any longer to be in force or used, as by the Command of God, though divers of those <hi>Jews,</hi> who believed the Testimony of the Apostles did not suddenly come off from those Shaddows, as may be seen by the Writings of the Apostles, they having been accustomed to them, they once ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been commanded by God, until they came to feel and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Anti-tipe or Substance, Christ within, they were not willing to let the Shadows go.</p>
               <p>Note, <hi>J. C.</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.27. it appears, that the time that Christ was betrayed, was the time Time of the <hi>Iews</hi> Passover; and when they delivered up Jesus to be judged, they would not go into the Judgment-Hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they eat the Passover.</p>
               <p>J. C. take further Notice, Christ said, <hi>He would not drink of the Fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom of God shall come,</hi> vers. 18. And Christ saith, <hi>There are some standing here, which shall not taste of Death till they see the Son of Man coming in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Mat. 16.21. He also saith, <hi>I tell you of a truth, there be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96767:39"/>some standing here, which shall not taste of Death till they see the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 9.27. And he further saith (speaking to the twelve Apostles, whom he sent to preach the Gospel) <hi>For verely, I say unto you, you shall not have gone about the Cities of</hi> Israel, <hi>till the</hi> SON OF MAN BE COME, Mat. 10.23.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that Christ spoke to those that did eat the Passover with him, saying, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me;</hi> and it also doth appear, that his Promise was to come unto them, [mark] them that did eat the Passover with him: He did not say, Deliver this unto your Children, and let it be delivered down through all Ages to the End of the World (that is to say) to eat Bread and drink Wine in Remembrance of Christ (as he STILL not being come) for the Apostle said, <hi>The Mystery that hath been hid from Ages and Generations, is now made manifest, which is Christ in you the Hope of Glory:</hi> And he said, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me:</hi> And of the true Church he said, <hi>Ye are all one in Christ Jesus:</hi> And he said, <hi>As you have received Christ Iesus the Lord, so walk in him.</hi> And Christ Jesus said, speaking of the Passover, <hi>I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God;</hi> this he spake the Night he was betrayed: So when he was crucified, the outward Eating or Shadow was fulfilled and ended, as I said before: And he said unto them that eat the Passover with him, <hi>He that is with you shall be</hi> IN YOU; <hi>I and my Father will come, and make our Abode</hi> WITH YOU; [mark, with you] even with those who eat the Outward Passover with him; and he fulfilled his Promise unto them. So he was their Passover, as the Apostle calls him, speaking thus, <hi>For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the Feast, not with Old Leven, neither with the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ven of Malice and Wickedness, but with the Ʋnleavened Bread of Sincerity &amp; Truth.</hi> The <hi>Christian</hi>-Passover is Christ the true Bread, which comes down from Heaven, which a man may eat of, and not dye, as he saith the Apostles and ancient grown <hi>Christians</hi> in those dayes did keep the spiritual Feast with the Unlevened Bread of Sincerity and Truth, as the Apostle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, feeding upon him their Passover, the Lamb of God, who taketh away the Sins of all that believe in him.</p>
               <p>Now had the <hi>Papists</hi> kept this spiritual Feast with the Unle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96767:39"/>Bread of Sincerity and Truth, they had not put the true <hi>Protestants</hi> to Death, which they did because they would not bow to their Idol of Bread and Wine: and if the now professed <hi>Protestants</hi> were gathered to this spiritual Feast, with the Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread of Sincerity &amp; Truth, then they would not persecute nor hate us, nor any other, for not sticking in or bowing to the Shadows, in Opposition to the Substance, which is Christ. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Galatians, That of they were circumcised, Christ should profit them nothing,</hi> Gal 5.2. We being come to know Christ (the Substance) he is our Passover, on him we feed, he is our Circumciser &amp; Baptizer; to us he is the End of all those Types and Shadows, and in him we are at Rest and Peace; we cannot go back into the Shadows, having tried the Weakness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableness of them; I say, we cannot go back into the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, though Men be displeased with us because thereof, that we cannot help; we cannot be Men pleasers in this Matter, as said the Apostle, <hi>We speak not as pleasing Men, but God, who tryeth our Hearts,</hi> 1 Thes. 2 4.</p>
               <p>In times past we have eaten Bread and drunk Wine, as others called <hi>Protestants</hi> do, and that in Zeal and Strictness, not then seeing nor enjoying the Substance or Anti-tipe; and those who are now under a Vail, not seeing nor enjoying the Sustance or Antipe, but continue in Zeal, eating Bread and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine, we leave them to the Lord; and our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Desires on their behalf are, That God may bring them to the Enjoyment of the Substance; and we have Hope, and that in God, That he will bring many Thousands in this Age unto it, who are yet Strangers from it; it is our Faith and Principle, That we ought not to use any Outward Violence or Force to bring any to our Faith and Practice in these Matters, but by the sound Doctrine of the Gospel, Good Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to convice the Gain-sayers; and it is our Faith and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That no <hi>Christian</hi> ought to use any other Weapons to bring any Person into Conformity to them in things relating to the Worship of God, which Worship is spiritual, in the Spirit and in the Truth, which Christ set up above sixteen hundred years ago.</p>
               <p>By what I have briefly written upon this Subject, those who are serious, &amp; read without Prejudice (who are contrary-minded to us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96767:40"/>in these things) may see something which may be of Advantage unto them towards the right understanding of those things treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; to do Good, and no Harm to any Man or Woman, is the thing that I endeavour to be found in, in all my Undertakings; and the Lord doth daily strengthen to do those things that are well-pleasing in his Sight; to him be all Glory, Dominion and Praise now and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the words of Christ, saying, <hi>This is my Body, which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you,</hi> I understand, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> do not believe, that that Bread and Wine which was eat and drunk the same Night he was betrayed, was really the Body and Blood of Christ, and therefore there need not much be said to them in that Matter; but it is a Truth, that his outward Body was there present, which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after was broken or crucified, &amp; also the invisible living Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which in fulness dwelt in that Body; this invisible Spirit and Life became the Food of the Souls of the Disciples and Church of Christ, after his outward Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension; and this is the true spiritual Meat and spiritual Drink, which the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God eat and drank of in the dayes of old; for it is written, <hi>They all eat the same spiritual Meat, they all drank the same spiritual Drink; they eat and drank of the Rock that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and that Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p>And as concerning <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water Baptism,</hi> it was in the time of the Law, before Christ was offered up (as I have said before) and it was a Shadow or Type of the inward spiritual Baptism of Christ: and <hi>John</hi> testified of Christ, saying, <hi>He must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, but I must decrease.</hi>
               </p>

But when Christ, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up himself once for all, had ended the Use of the Outward Temple, with the rest of the Shadows thereunto belonging, then the Apostle told the Believers in Christ, <hi>the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are; and he that defiles the Temple of God, him will God destroy;</hi> see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. &amp; to the faithful <hi>Christians</hi> he said, <hi>Ye also as lively Stones are built up a spiritual House, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5.</p>

For who is come to inherit the Promise of God and Christ, which is to know God and Christ reign within, there is no need of Water or any Shadow there: Then is fulfilled that which is written, <hi>Now is come Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Christ.</hi>

                  <hi>JOhn Cheyney,</hi> As concerning <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Prophecying,</hi> the Apostles and primitive Gospel Ministers, were made able Ministers of the New Testament, of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, as saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.6. they spoke or preached as the Spirit gave them utterance; they did not preach in Inticing Words of Man's Wisdom, but in the Demonstration of the Spirit, &amp; in Power, that the Faith of thore that heard them might not stand in the Wisdom of Man, but in the Power of God, as saith the Apostle; see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. They were not made Gospel-Ministers by humane Learning; for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were made able Gospel-Ministers, who were unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or Men that knew not Letters) as saith the Scripture; see <hi>Acts</hi> 4.3. The Apostles and Prophets did not go to Schools of Natural Learning four or seven years, after the manner of an Apprentiship, there to learn how to preach, prophesie or pray: <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were Fishermen, were called away from their Boats and Nets by Christ, and were taught by him to preach and pray powerfully, whereby many were converted to God; and so (as Christ said) <hi>He made them Fishers of Men. Paul</hi> was a Tentmaker; <hi>Elisha</hi> was a Plowman, and was called of God from the Plough, as it is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth; and <hi>Amos</hi> was an Herdsman; <hi>David,</hi> who was a Prophet, and an anointed King over <hi>Israel,</hi> was a Shepherd, and was called from the Sheep-coat; and <hi>Moses</hi> was keeping Sheep on the back of the Mountain when the Lord spoke to him to go to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> with whom God did wonderfully appear against <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and for the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> All the true Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets received their Prophesie, Testimony and Ministry freely and immediately from God; and as they received freely, so they prophesied, ministred and preached freely, as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But the Priests of the Nations called <hi>Christendom,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

In this one thing you are generally agreed, to <hi>sell your Sermons and Prayers:</hi> and also, you generally agree in studying and composing in your Earthly Wisdom your Sermons aforehand, and in boasting of other men's Lines made ready to your Hands, being out of the Spirit in which those men lived that gave them forth. The true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Ministers and Prophets did none of these things; but spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance those things that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, and that freely, without Money and without Price, of which the true Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> gave Testimony, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He, come ye to the Waters; he that hath no Money, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price,</hi> Isa. 55.1. And <hi>Iohn</hi> (the Gospel-Minister) saith, <hi>Every one that is athirst come, and drink of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely, Rev.</hi> 22.17. And the Apostle saith, <hi>I certifie you Brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Iesus Christ</hi> Gal 1.11, 12.</p>
               <p>So by what I have written, it is plainly manifest, that you differ in your Faith, Call, Preaching and Maintenance, from the true Gospel-Ministers and Prophets of God, spoken of in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>

               <p>Moreover, it is notoriously manifest, that the Priests of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Nations called <hi>Christians,</hi> do greatly differ from the ancient Gospel-Ministers and true <hi>Christians</hi> in their Forms and Manner of Prayer, and in their Fellowship &amp; Society therein; the <hi>Papists</hi> using Beads, with other sinful Inventions of fallen man in their Prayers; the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> having a Form of words printed in a Book, whereunto they are limited, and all forts of them when they pray Common Prayer, though never so wicked, use one and the same Form of Words, without respect to their various States and Conditions: This is contrary to the ancient true <hi>Christians;</hi> for the Apostle saith, <hi>With-draw your selves from every Brother that walketh disorderly,</hi> 2 Thess. 3.6.</p>

                  <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> the Apostle was sent to turn Ungodly Men from <hi>DARKNESS</hi> unto <hi>LIGHT,</hi> from Satan's power unto the Power of God; this then was and now is the Work of all the true Gospel-Ministers, and this would be thy Work, and the Work of thy Brethren the Priests, if you were true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Ministers.</p>
               <p>Man being turned from Satan's power to God's Power, the Power of God exerciseth the Mind and Heart towards God, and begetteth Heavenly Hungerings, Thirstings and Longings after the Living God Christ Jesus and his Glorious Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where nothing unclean can dwell; and the Power of God begets a Hatred, Loathing and Detestation in the Heart and Soul of Man (who is turned unto it (and exercised by it) against all Sin, and the Devil, who is the Author of it; and in such strong Prayers and Cryes arise in the Spirit of Christ, for Dominion and Victory over all in, and the Devil, who is the Author of it; and the Cryes of such God hears and answers; and such, who continue diligent in the exercise of the Power of the Lord God, they come to witness and enjoy as the primitive <hi>Christians</hi> did, of whom the Apostle testified, saying, <hi>Ye are of God, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and have overcome them, because greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the World;</hi> see 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4.

               <p>J. C. take notice, in your <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> you say, <hi>You are all poluted from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot,</hi> and that <hi>Ye are full of Bruises and putrifying Sores,</hi> and that <hi>Ye do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But in <hi>Psalm</hi> 23. you sing thus, <hi>My Shepherd is the living Lord, nothing therefore I need, in Pastures fair, with Waters calm, he sets me forth to feed; he did convert and glad my Soul, and brought my Mind in Frame, to walk in Paths of Righteousness for his most Holy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>J. C. take notice, here your Confession and your Psalm do not accord or agree; you say, <hi>You are all poluted,</hi> and have <hi>No Health in you,</hi> and then you sing in your Psalm, that your <hi>Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd is the living Lord,</hi> and <hi>therefore you need nothing:</hi> By your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96767:45"/>Confession it is manifest, you want a Saviour to save you from your Sins, and to heal you of your Bruises and putrifying Sores; here you do not sing with the Spirit, and with the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Apostle and Primitive Christians did, who had Psalms, Hymns and spiritual Songs immediately given them of God; but your Psalm and your Confession the one flatly contradicts the other, and so you are in confusion, building up, and throwing down that which you build. Again in <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.6. you say, <hi>All the Night long you wash your Beds with the Tears of your Complaint; and that your sight is dim, &amp;c.</hi> Now you know in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that the Generality of you do not do as you say (to wit) you do not generally (if there be any that do) wash your Beds with your Tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> is not this to sing Lyes in Hypocrisie? and dost thou think that such a Sacrifice as this will be acceptible to God? Oh Ignorance and Darkness! <hi>David</hi> did weep &amp; water his bed with his Tears, he bore the Indignation of God for his Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; when the just Judgment of God was upon him, he cryed unto the Lord, saying, <hi>Make me to hear Joy and Gladness, that the Bones which thou hast broken may rejoyce,</hi> Psalm 51.8. and the Lord heard &amp; answered his Prayer, pardoned his Iniquity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Shepherd, and supplied him with what was needful and made him to lie down in green Pastures, and led him beside the still Waters, see <hi>Psalm</hi> 23.12. But those that live in the Lust of the Flesh, and the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, who drink up Iniquity as an Oxdrinketh Water, who live in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Sports &amp; Pleasures of the World, &amp; Gluttonny, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c. who never yet came to true Repentance, to bear the Judgments of the Lord, these have nothing to do with <hi>David</hi>'s Words, who never knew <hi>David</hi>'s Conditions of weeping and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; God will turn the Songs of such into Howling and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness. And in <hi>Psalm</hi> 131. you sing thus, <hi>O Lord I am not puft in Mind, I have no scornful Eye, I do not exercise my self, in things that be too high; but as the Child that weaned is, even from his Mother's Breast, so have I, Lord, behav'd my self, in silence and in rest.</hi>

Thus much in short concerning your Psalms, and singing.</p>
               <p>The Apostle saith, <hi>If any be affl cted, let him pray, if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, or be merry, let him sing Psalms,</hi> James 5.13. This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture those that composed your Psalms have placed in the Title-page of them, thereby to gloss and set off their Work, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to esteem it, and to sing as they have taught you; but in so doing, they have either shewed great Ignorance, or great Dishonesty; for the Apostle <hi>James</hi> did not bid such as you say you are) SING, who are polluted from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, &amp;c. but it was the Members of the true Church, which is in God, that he wrote to, who did worship God in Spirit &amp; in Truth; for if you would stretch the Words to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all that have a mind to sing; then Thieves, Harlors, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, deba ched lewd Persons in Ale-houses and Taverns, who sing, and make merry with a Fidle and a Pipe, may sing Psalms as well as any other; but the singing spoken of by the Apostle, is peculiar to the Saints the redeemed of the Lord, who have waited upon him in the Way of his Righteous Judgments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Iniquity; and he hath given them Beauty for Ashes, and the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness; he hath, brought them out of spiritual <hi>Aegypt</hi> unto <hi>Zion,</hi> with Songs of Deliverance, and everlasting Joy upon their Heads. Again, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>If any be afflicted, let him pray.</hi> If you would strain his Words, that every one that is afflicted, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble must pray, then the wickedest or vilest man in the Earth must pray, such as <hi>Cai,</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> for these were both afflicted after they had done their Master's Drudgery; <hi>Cain</hi> said,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96767:46"/>
                  <hi>My Punishment is greater then I can bear;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, he went and threw down the Money and said, <hi>I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the Innocent Blood.</hi> But as I have shewed before in this Book, God who cannot lye hath said, <hi>The Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to him:</hi> And to the rebellious <hi>Jews</hi> he said, <hi>Your Hands are defiled with Blood, when you make many Prayers, I will not hear you;</hi> and the Lord spoke to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> concerning the rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> saying, <hi>Praynot thou for this People, neither lift up Cry, nor Prayer for them, neither make Intercession to me; for I will not hear thee,</hi> Jer. 7.16. Now if the Lord would not hear this holy Prophet on the behalf of these wicked men, certain it is he would not hear these wicked mens Prayers in this their old grown hardned State of wickedness. Some men may sin out the Day of their Visitation, till the Lord cease to strive with them; he saith, <hi>My Spirit shall not always strive with man;</hi> and it is written, <hi>To Day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> The Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man availeth much,</hi> James 5.16. This we believe; but the Prayers of a wicked; prophane, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, whilest such an one, Impenitent, we believe prevails not with God at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> Thus I have shewed, that in the outward Form of your Worship, you greatly differ from the primitive Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and primitive Church of Christ: But if you had the true Form, as they had, yet being out of the Power of God, in which they were (which is Christ within the Power and Wisdom of God; see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.) We are warranted by the Lord, and by his holy Apostle to turn away from you; see 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. It is not the MEER doing of things FORMALLY that was commanded by God, which makes the Doers thereof accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it is the doing of those things with an UPRIGHT HEART and Mind, in an holy Reverence towards God. That which I intend by thus distinguishing in these things si chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with respect to the Shadows of the Heavenly things, which Shadows are to pass away, yet it is possible that some Persons may do things that are morally good in themselves, and yet do them with a wrong Mind; as for Instance,</p>

               <head>Concerning Fasting in Reallity and Fasting in Hypocrisie.</head>
               <p>FAsting was practised by the people of God, both under the Law and Gospel; Christ fasted Forty Dayes and Forty Nights; the Apostles and Disciples of Christ were sometimes exercised in Fasting, as may be read in the Scriptures of Truth:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96767:47"/>Christ did not judge all Fasting and Fasters, but owned that which was done in Reallity, and condemned that which was done in Hypocrisie: Christ saith, <hi>When you fast, be not as the Hypocrites, of a sad Countenance; for they dis-figure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to fast; verely I say unto you, they have their Reward: But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy Head, and wash thy Face, that thou appear not unto Men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly,</hi> Mat. 6.16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that several Persons may act one and the same thing, in the outward form; the one do what they do in REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITY unto God, and therein are ACCEPTED; the other do what they do in HYPOCRISIE, and therefore are REJEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED: One great Instance whereof I shall further shew.</p>

               <head>Concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> Sacrifices and Offerings in the Time of their Faithfulness, and concerning their Offerings and Sacrifices in the time of their Rebellion and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</head>
               <p>THE Lord commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of the Law to offer unto him Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices, and while they kept in his Fear, in the Exercise of his Spirit, that he gave them to instruct them, as thou mayest read <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9.20. their Sacrifices and Offerings were pleasant and acceptable to him. <hi>Malachy</hi> the Prophet prophesied of Christ, saying, <hi>He shall sit as a Refiner, and Purifier of Silver, and he shall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteousness; then shall the Offerings of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem <hi>be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old, and as in former years;</hi> see <hi>Malachy</hi> 3.3, 4. Thus it appears that their Offerings were acceptable whilst they kept in Sincerity to the Lord. Now hear what the Lord saith by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, of the Apostatized Rebellious <hi>Iews, He that killeth an Ox, is as if he slew a Man; he that sacrificeth a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96767:48"/>Lamb, as if he cut off a Dog's Neck; he that off reth an Oblation, as if he offered Swine's Blood; he that burneth Incense, as if he blessed an Idol; yea, they have chosen their own Wayes, and their Soul delighteth in their Abomination,</hi> Isa. 66.3.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that though the <hi>Iews</hi> did offer things in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which the Law of God required, and that while the Law was in force, yet were they not accepted, because their Hearts were not right before him; they were gone a whoring in their Heaats after other Lovers, and their Souls delighted in those things which God abhorred; and as the holy Prophet said (else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) They set up their Idols in their Hearts; and therefore the Lord compares their killing of an Ox to the slaying of a Man, which sense of slaying a Man as here intended, I understand to be Murder; God's Command was and is, <hi>Thou shalt do no Murder.</hi> And the burning incense he compares to those that blessed or worshipped an Idol. To Worship an Idol was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God, as may be read in his Law. And the Lord saith, <hi>He that sacrificeth a Lamb, it is as if he cut off a Dogs Neck.</hi> A Dog was esteemed an Unclean Beast (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law) not to be eaten or offered in Sacrifice. He saith, <hi>He that offereth an Oblation, is as if he offered Swines Blood.</hi> A Swine under that Shadowy Dispensation of the Law was forbidden to be eaten, or offered in Sacrifice, as being then esteemed unclean.</p>

And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>Philip,</hi> who is called an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> had four Daughters Virgins, who did prophene or preach in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel time, as thou mayest read <hi>Acts</hi> 21.8, 9. <hi>Miriam, Huldah, Hannah</hi> these all were Prophetesses under the Law; and if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might prophesie under the Law, then under the Gospel they are not to be forbidden; for the Gospel is more universal and large, then the Dispensation of the Law was; which Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel brings Life and Immortallity to Light, both to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; in and through which the Knowledge of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes plentiful, both in men and women, even as Waters are plentiful in the Sea: And this is according to the Promise of God in the New Covenant, who said, <hi>They shall all know me from the greatest of them unto the least of them. Mary Magdalen</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Resurrection of Christ unto his Disciples; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> beseeched one of the Brethren a Yoke-Fellow, <hi>To help those WOMEN who LABOƲRED with him in the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 4.3. and he doth grant, or allow women to prophesie &amp; pray, but speaks against the womens having their Heads uncovered when they prophesie or pray, see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>

What dost thou think J.

And do not you Priests count those Gracious words, which those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men spake, Good Gospel? and do not you make a Trade of their Words, and sell them for Money, (which they did not, but spoke them freely) and were they not better Preacher then you Priests are? do not you boast of these Holy Womens Words, or Lines made ready to your Hands? consider of these things.</p>
               <p>The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> Preached better then you Priests; she brought or directed her Neighbours unto Christ, in whom is Life, Peace and Eternal Salvation.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God commanded <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet to go <hi>Naked,</hi> as it is written in the Holy Scriptures. <hi>And the Lord said unto</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah, <hi>loose thy sack-cloth from off thy Loyns, and put off thy Shoe from thy Foot, and he did so, walking Naked and Bare-Foot, three Years, for a sign upon</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Ethiopia, as God commanded him, see <hi>Isaiah</hi> 20:</p>
               <p>And it hath been the Spiritual Nakedness, Wickedness, and Treacherousness of the Priests of <hi>England,</hi> and the Wickedness of many of the Inhabitants thereof, which hath been the Cause that some amongst the <hi>Quakers</hi> have gone Naked outwardly, as true Signs of their Spiritual Nakedness; and also of the Just Judgments, which God has in Measure brought to pass &amp; will yet bring upon the Inhabitants of this Nation more abundantly, if they do not unfeignedly repent. Thus it appears that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Example for their going Naked in the Scriptures of Truth; but the Priests of <hi>England</hi> have no Example from Christ Jesus nor the Holy Apostles, for the wearing of Gold Rings, or superfluous Apparel, nor for hating &amp; persecuting those who were sent by the Lord amongst them, to go Naked, as Signs of the Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of the Priests and people of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Raising the Dead is the Work of God and Christ, who only can give Life, and if any person in his Imagination, through the Temptation of Satan, hath attempted any such thing, that person is judged by the Lord God, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in that his presumptuous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We truly and dearly own the Scriptures or Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bible; but the words contained in that Book are not all of equal Authority one with another. See thy own Testimony concerning the Scriptures or Bible, which is as followeth, <hi>The
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96767:52"/>Scriptures are not God, Christ nor the Spirit; but Laws and Doctrines, Histories and Reports, given by Inspiration of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, the words which God spake unto man saying, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> WERE and ARE of greater Authority then those words which as History or Relation declare of the Wars and Battels of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and other such Historical Matters, and of greater Authority to an amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> then those words that related to Circumcision, the Blood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the words of Christ, who said to his Disciples, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches; as the Brenches cannot bring forth Fruit except they abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me:</hi> And <hi>Without me ye can do nothing—My Flesh is Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and my Blood is Drink indeed—Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Words are of greater Authority then the Relations or Histories of the Apostles outward Travail by Sea and Land; and they are of greater Authority then those words that speak of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cloak, that he lest at <hi>Troas,</hi> mentioned in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. and all other such Historical Matters.</p>
               <p>The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do prefer and esteem the Book called the <hi>Bible</hi> or holy Scriptures above any outward Writing or Book extant upon the Earth, because of the Verity and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of deep heavenly Sayings, uttered by God unto <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, through the several Ages of the World, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and eminently through the heavenly Man Christ Jesus, who was anointed with the Oyl of Gladness above his Fellows, and filled with the Spirit without measure. Nevertheless, we do affirm, that the Spirit of God in this Age, hath moved several of us to write Books, which have been instrumental in his Hand for Good unto many, with respect to their Immortal Souls. God the Holy One changeth not, neither is he to be limitted; and all our Books and Writings are not of equal Authority one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; some treat of our inward Experience of the Work of God, in which are contained words which do direct Man and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96767:53"/>Woman to the Manifestation of the Spirit of God, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to profit withal; to the Grace of God, which brings Salvation; to the Light, wherewith Christ lighteth every one that comes into the World. Some others of our Books do treat of our Sufferings, and outward Exercises, &amp;c. which though all of them be true, yet some are of greater weight then others. And Destruction comes upon People because they do not believe in and obey the Light. Grace and Spirit of God, which he hath given them, to lead them out of Sin, into all Truth. Those who read our Writing, without Prejudice, may receive Good thereby, as by Instruments which God makes use of; and such who do so, they will return the Glory to God, as we do: And those who read our Books in Envy and Malice, the Murdering Spirit blinds their Minds, and God doth candemn such.</p>

But we do believe, that those Servants who believe in Christ, who differ from their Masters in Faith and Worship, yet notwithstanding ought to be very diligent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant to obey their Masters Commands, in all those Just Trusts and Labours, according to the Covenant which they have made &amp; for which they take Hire or receive Reward of their Masters; and they ought to behave them selves in Meekness and Humility in their Words and Carriage to them; and we believe, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to do unto their Servants that which is Just, even as they would have others to do to them and theirs in the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, considering that God is the Great Master, above all earthly Masters, unto whom all must give an Account for the Deeds which they have done in the Body, and must receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from him accordingly, whether they be bond or free: And if a Servant be a Brother or Sister in the Faith of Christ unto the Master, Dame or Mistris, which he or she doth serve; we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96767:54"/>believe all such ought to be very diligent and faithful in their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and serve with true Fear as the Holy Apostle exhorteth; for we know the Faith of Christ doth not destroy the Place of a Servant, but if Servants obey him, he will cause them to excel in Diligence, Truth and Faithfulness in all their Services; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Let as many Servants as are under the Yoke [Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Engagement] count their own Masters worthy of all Honour, that the Name of God and his Doctrine be not blasphemed; and they that have believing Masters, let them not</hi> DESPISE <hi>them, because they are</hi> BRETHREN, <hi>but rather do them Service,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 6.1, 2.</p>

                  <hi>4thly, Paul</hi> exhorts, to Obey Magistrates, and to be ready to every good Work, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governours, as unto them that are sent by him, for the Punishment of Evil-doers, and for the Praise of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rulers are not a Terror to Good Works, but to the Evil — do that which is Good, and thou shalt have Praise of the same,</hi> Rom. 13.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J C.</hi> these Exhortations and Doctrines are owned by the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> both in Word and Practice: And those Rulers, Governours or Magistrates, who are a Terror to the Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, and a Praise to those that do well, are worthy of Honour, yea, of double Honour and all such are duly honoured by us with the Honour which belongs unto them. And we really and with Pleasure Honour and Obey all such, not for fear of the Wrath, but for good Conscience sake, as the Apostles and primitive <hi>Christians</hi> did. But if in some things some Magistrates do req ire those things of us which are contrary to the Command and Law of our God, in those things we chuse to obey God, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to endure the Pain and Penalties which they do or may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon us because of our Obedience to God; and for such our Prayers and Supplications are poured forth unto God, that they may find Mercy through Unfeigned Repentance; and whatsoever is good, just and Equal in the Actions of such, that we own, and really consent to, and act accordingly wherein we are concerned; and the contrary we witness against by peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patient Suffering: And for this our Practice we have Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Command from Christ Jesus, and Example and Precepts
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96767:55"/>from the holy Apostles and Prophets; for if Christ, the Apostles and Prophets could have submitted to every Law, Decree or Ordinance of Man or Ruler, without Respect of those Laws or Ordinances being good or bad, right or wrong, then they had not suffered those Cruelties which they did suffer: Those that put Christ to Death pretended Law for what they did; those that cast <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Den of Lyons, they had a Law for it, but it was not the Law of God; those that cast the Three Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fiery Furnace, they had a Law for it, but it was not the Law of God; <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was a Persecutor of the Church of God, he got Letters from the High Priest to persecute both Men and Women that called upon the Name of the Lord; and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> that persecuted the Apostles and ancient <hi>Christians,</hi> they made and had Laws for their Cruelty, but they were not the Laws of God; the Professors in <hi>New-England</hi> in our dayes have made Laws to put the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> to Death for no Evil, but because they preached the Everlasting Gospel freely, and worshipped God in the Spirit, this their Law is not the Law of God, but is of him that was a Lyar &amp; a Murderer from the beginning, who led wicked <hi>Cain</hi> to kill righteous <hi>Abel</hi> about Sacrifice, this is he of whom <hi>John</hi> testified, saying, <hi>The Devil shall cast some of you into Prison:</hi> This is he who has blinded, hardned &amp; betwitched many Teachers &amp; People, so that they have thought &amp; think they do God Service when they persecute &amp; kill the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ: Of this Christ prophesied, saying to his Disciples, <hi>The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think they do God Service,</hi> John 16.2.

He answered, and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man; the Field is the World; the good seed are the Children of the Kingdom; but the Tares are the Children of the Wicked One; the Enemy, that sowed them, is the Devil; the Harvest is the</hi> END OF THIS WORLD; <hi>and the Reapers are the</hi> ANGELS: <hi>As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tares are gathered and burnt in the Fire, so shall it be in the</hi> END OF THIS WORLD: <hi>The Son of Man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity, and shall cast them into a Furnace of Fire, there shall be Wailing and Knashing of Teeth;</hi> THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS <hi>shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of the Father: who hath an Ear to hear, let him hear,</hi> Mat. 13.27, 28, 29, 30. &amp; 36 to 43.</p>

                  <hi>J.

               <p>Christ saith, <hi>Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them; for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.12. <hi>And as ye would that men should do unto you, do ye also to them likewise; for if you love those that love you, what Thank have you? for Sinners love those which love them—And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what Thank have you? for Sinners also do even the same,</hi> Luke 6. vers. 31, 32, 33.

               <p>
                  <hi>J.

And it doth also appear, that Christ hath not appointed the <hi>Heathen, Jewish, Papist, Episcopal, Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Priests, and their Informers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, or any of them, to be the Reapers or Gatherers out of his Kingdom those things which do offend, or to gather the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which are as the Tares, nor to cast them into the Fire; nor is the Time yet come in which that Work is to be done, as Christ saith; for he saith, The Reapers are the Angels, and the Harvest is the End of THIS WORLD. Thus it appears plainly, that the False Prophets, Priests and Teachers, their Informers and Abettors, who have persecuted the true <hi>Christians</hi> through the several Ages of the World, have not therein been found in the Work of God. WHO IS LOVE, nor of CHRIST, who came not to destroy mens Lives, but to save them; BUT in the Work of him who is the Father of Lyes, and a Murderer, as Christ hath said: so it is high time for this Generation of men to give over
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96767:57"/>these their Abominable Works to throw aside their carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, by which they have warred and slain the Servants of God for their pure Obedience to him, which Christ and the Apostles never did, nor gave Precept or Example for.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> here G. F. speaks of the Soul of man in several States and Conditions; <hi>first,</hi> In Death, and Transgression. It is very certain that G. F. doth not believe, that God ever was or can be in Transgression; and therefore it is certain, that when he speaks of the Soul's being in Transgression, that therefore he doth not mean or intend, that God his Essence or Being, in any Measure or Part is in Transgression, or ever can be so.</p>
               <p>Again he speaks of the <hi>Living of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>the spirit san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> and saith, that <hi>diligent hearkning is come to,</hi> where <hi>the Counsel of God is stood in, his Voice heard, his Hand felt;</hi> that the Soul comes up into, where the Soul lives; note J.C. here he speaks of the Soul's living, and of its HEARKNING: It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96767:58"/>here, that G. F. doth not mean, intend, or believe, that God should hearken to himself, or that by not hearkning to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he should come into Transgression and Death; or that by hearkning he should be redeemed, or sanctified; for G. F. believes, that God is unchangeably Holy, without any Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Mutability.</p>
               <p>Again, G. F. speaks of receiving God's Counsel and standing in it, by which the Soul comes to live. Now it is certain that G. F. believes not, that God could possibly go or act against his own Counsel, and so come into Transgression and Death; but it is clear that G. F. believes, that when God's Counsel is not stood in by man, who was made a living Soul, that then he goes into Transgression, and his Soul comes into Death; and this was fulfilled in the First <hi>Adam</hi> (who was made a living Soul) by his going out of the Counsel of God he became a Transgressor, and his Soul was brought into Death thereby: But as the Apostle saith, <hi>The second</hi> Adam <hi>was made a Quickning Spirit,</hi> which second <hi>Adam</hi> is Christ the promised Seed, which bruiseth the Head of him that first led man out of the Counsel of God, whereby his Soul was brought into Death; who believes in him who lighteth every one that cometh into the World, he raiseth the Soul out of Death, being the Captain of its Salvation and the Bishop of it.</p>
               <p>Again, Soul being taken for Life, as sometimes it is; God is the Life of Lives, or great Original Soul of Souls, being that one Infinite Being, by which all other Beings in the Beginning of the Creation were brought forth; and by whose Word, Life and Power they exist, and are upheld: And G. F. speaking in answer to the Priests about the Soul, saith, <hi>God breathed into</hi> MAN <hi>the Breath of Life, and</hi> HE <hi>became a living Soul; for that which came out from God was the Cause that</hi> MAN <hi>became</hi> alive, A LIVING SOUL. Upon the afore cited words in <hi>Genesis,</hi> G. F. pag. 68. querieth of the Priests thus, <hi>And is not this of God? And God who hath all Souls in his Hand;</hi> here, and in this latter sense it doth appear, that G. F. takes that word <hi>Soul</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> or that Breath by which Man lived, or was made a living Soul; and this Breath and Life, by which Man lived or became a living Soul IS OF GOD, thus G. F. and the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe; and also that this Breath or Life cannot transgress, or be in Transgression,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96767:58"/>though the Motions of it IN THE SOUL MAY be quenched, and it grieved; for so it is when man hearkens unto, and takes COUNSEL at the serpent, who first drew man from God's COUNSEL; and thus, as it is written, <hi>God is grieved with the Wicked every Day.</hi> His Displeasure or Grief is, because he would have Man to hearken to his Voice, and be saved, but Man; WILL NOT, as God complained of old, <hi>They rejected all my</hi> COUNSEL, <hi>and would have none of my</hi> REPROOF.</p>
               <p>In this latter Sense taking the Soul for that Life, or Breath, by which Man lived, or became a Living SOUL, this, as G. F. saith (p. 68). is <hi>Infinite,</hi> which he must needs intend, as his own words do import, being taken in their own proper and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Sense.</p>
               <p>It appears in G. F's Controversie with the Priests about the Soul, that he takes up the Word SOUL, and speaks of it under three considerations, <hi>1st, The Soul of Man</hi> in Transgression <hi>IN DEATH; 2dly, The Soul of Man</hi> in the Restoration <hi>IN LIFE,</hi> and <hi>3dly</hi> he speaks of the Word <hi>SOƲL,</hi> as being that Breath or Life, which came forth from God, by which MAN LIVED or BECAME A LIVING SOUL, which Breath and Life is of God's Being, and Infinite, as I said before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JOhn Cheyney,</hi> in thy Book entituled <hi>Quakerism Heresie,</hi> p. 11, &amp; 7. thou cavillest against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they use the Scripture word MEASURE.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ said, <hi>He whom God hath sent, speaketh the</hi> WORDS <hi>of God; for God giveth not the spirit by Measure unto him,</hi> see Joh. 3.34. By this it appears that Christ did distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Fulness,</hi> and it is written, <hi>That it pleased the Father that the Fullness of the Godhead should dwell in the Son;</hi> and also it is written, <hi>That he was anointed with the Oyl of Gladness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Fellows.</hi> By this it appears, that his Fellows (or as he called them, his Brethren) had the Spirit measureably, and were anointed with it: The Apostle said, <hi>We will not boast of things with out our</hi> MEASURE, <hi>but according to the Measure of the</hi> RULE <hi>which God hath distributed to us, a Measure to reach unto you; for we do not</hi> STRETCH <hi>our selves beyond our</hi> MEASURE;— <hi>Not boasting of things without our</hi> MEASURE, <hi>that is of other Mens</hi> LABOURS;—<hi>Not to boast in other</hi> MENS LINE <hi>of things made</hi> READY TO OUR HAND, see 2 Cor. 10.13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> by this it appears, that the Apostle did not esteem other Mens Labours nor their Line his [Rule] but the Life and Spirit of God, which is the Light of Men, was certainly his and the rest of the Holy Apostles RULE, by which they came to know God, and Christ, &amp; their Duty unto God and Christ, and to all men; &amp; to dotheir Duty and this is according to Christ's Promise unto his Disciples, who said, <hi>The spirit of Truth shall lead you into all Truth;</hi> &amp; also said, <hi>God is a spirit, and they that worship him they must wor ship him in the spirit &amp; in the Truth.</hi> The Spirit is that which was before the Scriptures, by which Men were made Holy before they gave them forth, and as it is written, the Apostles in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Dispensation, did not worship in the oldness of the Letter, but in the Newness of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. And the Apostle said, <hi>Ʋnto every one of us is given Grace according to the</hi> MEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SURE
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96767:60"/>
                  <hi>of the Gift of Christ;—And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors, and some Teachers, for the</hi> PERFECTING <hi>of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, &amp;.</hi> see Ephes. 4.8, 11. And they were made able Ministers, NOT of the LETTÈR, but of the SPIRIT: Thus it evidently appears, that the Spirit of God and Christ was their Rule, and Guide into all Truth, and it was Measurably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and given unto them according to the Good Pleasure of the Giver, and according to their several Capacities, and the several Services which God called them unto; and at this Christ pointed in the Parable, where he saith, <hi>There was given unto one five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and to another two Talents, and to another one Talent.</hi> And it is also said, <hi>The Manifestation of the spirit is given unto every one to profit withal.</hi> The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do not divide God into Measures, Pieces and Shreds, as thou darkly and wickedly talkest, but they own God to be Indevisible, he cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he is Onmipresent (or Present every where) yet he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably manifests, or shews himself unto Man; this in short is in answer to thy vain Cavils about Measure.</p>

                  <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> say, The Life of God, which is the Light of and in men, is in no Fault when men commit Sin, as is largely proved in the Beginning of this Book; and thou hast proved the Light within to be without Fault when men sin; thou sayest, it is no Fault of God, nor of Christ, nor of the Spirit, and we never preacht any other Light for Salvation, but God who is a Spirit, and Christ who is the express Image or Character of his Substance, and Brightness of his Glory, who is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is made a quickning Spirit, as saith the Apostle; so that which thou hast confest, <hi>That God, Christ and the Spirit are blameless when Men sin,</hi> thou hast overthrown thy whole Work against the Light within.</p>
               <p>J. C. in p. 26. thou bidst <hi>W. P.</hi> examine himself (&amp; thou sayest) <hi>I do not say the Spirit moves m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Herein thou shewest thy Folly, Presumption and Hard-heartedness, in mocking at the Spirit of God, and exalting thy Reason to be the moving or principal Cause of thy bidding <hi>W. P.</hi> try himself; thou hast confessed elsewhere, <hi>That we can do no good work without the special help of God's Spirit,</hi> see <hi>Call to Prayer,</hi> p. 20. so if thou wouldst have had thy Words to <hi>W. P.</hi> accounted a good Work, thou shouldst have spoken to him in the Motion of the Spirit, according to thy own Principle; but thou manifest shy prophane Spirit in scoffing at the Spirit of God:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96767:64"/>Thou professest the Scriptures to be thy Rule, but thou art never able to prove by them that any of the true Prophets or Apostles did mock at the Spirit of God, or that they said, they did not say that the Spirit moved them when they did speak to any Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of God's Kingdom, nor that they said their Reason prompts them. Thou wouldst falsly insinuate against <hi>W. P.</hi> that he holds, <hi>That Reason is God,</hi> or <hi>God is Reason;</hi> but dost not thou make that which thou callst thy Reason, to be thy God? seeing thou mockst at the Spirit of God, and sayest, <hi>Thy Reason prompt thee to speak.</hi> I say, it is the Spirit of God which ONLY gives the Knowledge of the Things of God, and that is it which the Holy Prophets &amp; Apostles were moved by in all things which did relate to God's Kingdom, and that Spirit and no other do we own to be led by to speak do or act in the things that do belong unto the Kingdom of God and Christ, whose Kingdom is spiritual.</p>
               <p>J. C. thou sayest, <hi>The Spirit of God only can open the Eyes of our Minds to undrstand the Scriptures, and to cure us of our Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> see <hi>Quakerism. subverted,</hi> p. 29.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God and Heaven were before the Scriptures, yea, and Holy Men were before the Holy Scriptures, as I have shewed before, and God is not upheld by any Creature, but by his own Power, by which he created all things, and by it the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upheld; and God is infinite, from Everlasting to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, without Mutation or Change: And though wicked men might destroy the Scriptures, as they did the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s Roll, yet God remains, who caused <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to write a new Roll after the wicked had burnt one, <hi>And</hi> Jeremiah <hi>writ all the Words that were in the first Roll in the latter,</hi> see Jer. 36.22, 23, 28, 32. And God is where the Scriptures or Outward Writing is not: So thou talkst ignorantly in this matter, as in the rest of thy confused Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> in thy Book <hi>Call to Prayer,</hi> p. 110. thou boastest of some that were <hi>Quakers, and were troubled in Conscience, and that they could not ease their Souls, but by returning to you, and that they are now envyed by the</hi> Quakers; and thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>know thou sayest the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Those thou in Scorn callst <hi>Quakers</hi> know thou speakst

               <p>And as to thy boast of some turned from the <hi>Quakers</hi> to you, if some such there be they will have Cause to repent of it, and I wish they may come to true Repentance before it be too late; and as to the Peace they have among you, it being in Sin, as you say, you are all miserable Sinners, this Peace is not the Peace of God, and therefore God will break it. What if some that have been called <hi>Quakers</hi> be come amongst you? thou dost not tell us the Number, they are so very few: There went a <hi>Judas</hi> out from amongst the Twelve; and some that had tasted of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift, and of the Power of that world that is Without End, they afterwards fell away; those who have known Cleansing and Washing in Measure, turned with the Dog and Swine to the Vomit and Mire again; and the Apostle speaks of such, who went out from the true Church, who were not of it; <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued with us, &amp;c.</hi> Your Way is a broad Way; therfore many chuse it.</p>

               <head>Some of <hi>John Cheyney</hi>'s many Contradictions to himself about Light and Darkness.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IOhn Cheyney</hi> saith in <hi>Quakerism Subverted,</hi> pag. 17. <hi>God's Essence (or Being) is unconfined, it fills Heaven and Earth.</hi> And in page 10 he confesses, <hi>God is Light and Omnipresent, and so both within Man and without him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe, Reader, Herein <hi>J. C.</hi> saith the Truth.</p>
               <p>Pag. 13. <hi>J. C.</hi> saith; <hi>We are sure, that there is not anything at all in every Man, nor in any Man, that is or can be God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe again, Herein he flatly contradicts what he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for God being Omnipresent, his Essence (or being) unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or unconfined, he Light, both within Man and without Man, is therefore in Man.</p>
               <p>Pag. 14. Observe further, <hi>J. C.</hi> saith, <hi>That can't be true which no man's Heart will give him leave to affirm; but no man's Heart will give him leave to affirm, that there is in him a certain Light, that is God, the Maker of all things: If any should say it, he is rather to be counted a Monster then a Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe, <hi>J. Cheyney</hi> hath (as before is cited) affirmed, <hi>That God's Essence (or being) is unconfined, it fills Heaven and Earth, his Essence is no more in one place then in another:</hi> And confesses, <hi>God is Light, and Omnipresent, and so both within man and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</hi> Herein his Heart hath given him leave (as he phrases it) to speak the Truth, and this speaking of the Truth doth not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him a Monster, and No Man (as his Phrase also is.)</p>
               <p>Pag. 15. Note further, that <hi>J. C.</hi> quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. which proves, that Christ is in the Saints; he quotes <hi>Isaiah</hi> 57.15 where its said, <hi>God dwells with those that are of an Humble and Contrite Spirit.</hi> And in the same page he grants <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>God.</hi> And in Vers. 16, 17. he grants, <hi>That Christ and God dwells in the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in flat Contradiction to all this (pag. 13.) he plainly saith, <hi>That there is not any thing</hi> at all <hi>in every man, nor in any man</hi> that is or can be God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sermons of Hypocrisie,</hi> pag. 233. J. C. saith, <hi>The Light is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96767:68"/>in all men, and it is from God, and it is good; it is the Excellency of Man, as such, compared with Bruits; the vilest Man by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this is of more price then all the World; its this that makes the Soul of Man to be superlatively precious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 234. <hi>J. C.</hi> saith, <hi>There is not, nor ever was, nor ever shall be any Sin committed by any Man or Devil, but the Light within hath a principal Hand in it, and is peccant, and truly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before God.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, for its utterly impossible that that which is good [mark, that which is good] should have the principal Hand in all the Sins of Men and Devils, and be the Author of all the Sin in the World, and so of the utter Perdition of Men and Devils. This is not only contradictory to himself, but horribly Blasphemous against God, <hi>whom he confesses to be Light, and</hi> WITHIN MAN, see pag. 10. of the same Book. And I affirm, that this his Charge against the Light is Blasphemy against the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, see <hi>John</hi> 1.4.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Call to Praeyer,</hi> pag. 118. J. C. saith, <hi>I'le till what keeps me from Prayer, When my Consciences and the</hi> LIGHT WITHIN <hi>moves me to Prayer, my Sloath and Laziness, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe Reader, He grants the <hi>Light Within</hi> moves him to pray; and grants, his <hi>Sloath</hi> and <hi>Laziness</hi> keeps him from it. By these words he justifies the Light, and condemns himself; but if the Light were so bad as he renders it before, as being guilty of all the Sin in the World (which none is guilty of but the DEVIL HIMSELF) then his Prayers were not likely to be acceptable to God. But we own his former Confession to the Light (to wit) That it is Good, and that it moves to pray (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God (acceptably) and also, that Sloath and Laziness may and doth hinder him and such as he is.</p>
               <p>And in pag. 119. he grants, that <hi>the Light within may move to pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:96767:68"/>
               <p>But in pag. 117. he saith, <hi>I dare say, let the Light within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, say nothing to it, it shall never move any</hi> Quaker <hi>or Ʋngodly Soul to pray till Death, or the Flames of Hell awaken them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe Reader, that this latter, wherein he saith, <hi>The Light Within will never move to pray till Death, or the Flames of Hell shall awaken,</hi> is a flat Contradiction to his saying, <hi>it moved him to pray, and it may move to pray, &amp;c.</hi> and I say, this is Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against the Life of God, which is the Light of men.</p>
               <p>In pag. 119. J. C. saith, <hi>In all Impenitent Ones Darkness is stronger then the Light; for though the Light Within may move, it will be but a weak Motion; and the Motion of the</hi> DARK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, <hi>or Fleshly Part, will</hi> OVERCOME <hi>and</hi> DROWN <hi>the</hi> LIGHT, <hi>and bring it</hi> UNDER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe, Reader, in the before cited words J. C. grants, that the Light may move (to PRAYER) but the DARK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS being STRONGER then it, the Darkness or fleshly part will Drown and Overcome the Light. By this he distinguishes BETWEEN the Light and the Darkness, and shews a WAR or OPPOSITION between them. In distinguishing between them as Light and Darkness (IN OPPOSITION) he hath said well, though in flat Contradiction to himself, as through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of his Books may be seen, where he calls the Light <hi>Darkness,</hi> and confounds Light and Darkness together, as being one; for in pag. 247. of <hi>Sermons of Hypocrisie,</hi> he saith, <hi>The Light within till Regeneration, is Darkness, &amp;c.</hi> also in page 236. he calls it <hi>Darkness;</hi> and in the next page saith, <hi>Its a sinful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, self destroying Light.</hi> This his Distinction is an absolute Overthrow to all his whole Work against the Light within.</p>
               <p>Reader, observe, J. C's Distinction between Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (as being in WAR or OPPOSITION) we own. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the Light moves to pray, and that Sloath and Laziness doth hinder those that give way thereto: We also say, that the who hates the Light, and loves Darkness, may have more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the strength of Darkness, then with the strength of the Light, yet is the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, stronger then the Darkness; and they who love the Light, and walk therein, know it to be so, as the Apostle said, <hi>Greater is He that is in us, then he that is in the World, by whom we overcome them,</hi> to wit, the World.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:96767:69"/>
               <p>But Reader, consider; why should <hi>J. C.</hi> be so UNCHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITABLE in sensuring the Light, as being guilty of all the Sin in the World, &amp;c. seeing he confesses it moves to Prayer, and opposes the DARKNESS? And if that were true that he saith of the Light (to wit) <hi>That the Darkness brings it under,</hi> yet still he grants an OPPOSITION and a WAR between them; so that it is not by the Light's CHOICE, WILL and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT, to and with the Darkness, that it is brought under; for he saith, its OVERCOME &amp; DROWNED by the DARK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS. And admit the thing were as he saith, why should the Light Within be CHARGED with all the Sin in the World, seeing it WARS AGAINST THE DARKNESS, and doth what it can (in <hi>J. C</hi>'s sense) seeing it is the Darkness that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERCOMES and DROWNS it (as he phrases it) Thus it appears, that the Power of Darkness is originally guilty of all the Sin in the World, and that the Light is clear from being guilty of ANY SIN.</p>
               <p>Oh, Self conceited <hi>J. C!</hi> how hast thou confounded and contradicted thy self in fighting against the Light? thou art fallen in the Pit thou hast digged, and the Net that thou hast said hath taken thy own Feet.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lye</hi> 10. He saith, <hi>There is no Doctrine so vile and blasphemous, no Practice so odious and lewd, but that the</hi> Quakers <hi>wrest the Scriptures, and make them the Patrons of their Impieties,</hi> p. 8. of his Premonition to <hi>Sermons of Hypocrisie.</hi>

               <p>Note, This particular Charge, as J. C hath divided the matter, hath in it, 9 Lyes at least, which makes up the preceding 13 Lyes 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lye</hi> 23. He saith, <hi>There is not an Article of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the</hi> Quakers <hi>subvert it,</hi> Quak. Her. p. 31.</p>
               <p>He saith. <hi>The sum of all their Writings and Teachings, is to call people off from the true God, and the true Christ and the true spirit, and Scripture, and Ministry, and Worship,</hi> Quakerism subverted, p. 23.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a notorious Lye: Thy Blasphemy against God who is Light, and thy Lyes against his People, proves thee to be fallible; for the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not say, that thou and thy Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who hate the Light, and love your Evil Deeds, are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, neither do we say, that any man is infallible, as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, he living in subjection to the Spirit of the Lord, that leads and inables him to do the Will of the Lord, that is alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep him from failing in his Duty to God or Man, and no Man is otherwise infallible, but as he is so made and kept by the Spirit and Power of the Lord, which Spirit is infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lye</hi> 30. He saith, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>by their Books and Principles — Send us all to Hell, Call to Prayer,</hi> p. 122.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96767:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> O horrible Slander! Our Principle would bring you all to Heaven, if you would obey it, which is the Life of God, which is the Light of Men. Before thou chargest the <hi>Quakers</hi> to make you all infallible, and those that be infallible do not go to Hell, but to Heaven: here thy Confusion is manifest.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>are greatly forsaken by God, and are one of the saddest spectacles of spiritual misery, and Infatuation, as this Age hath afforded,</hi> Premon. to Ser. of Hyp. p. 6.</p>
               <p>In this Charge there is 2 Lyes: which makes the Number 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lye</hi> 33. He saith, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>say they are Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A horrible and abominable Lye. What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be done unto thee, thou false Tongue? <hi>sharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty, with Coals of Juniper,</hi> Psal. 120.3.4. Oh thou ungodly man, the Wrath of God will fall heavy upon that lying Spirit, which is thy Captain, Head and Law giver; Oh that thou couldest find a place of Repentance, that so thou mayest be separated from that cursed lying Spirit, which if thou be not, thou must inherit the Lake of Everlasting Misery with it, where the Worm doth not dye, and the Fire is not quenched; thou art desperately wicked in these with the rest of thy Lyes: We never said, we were Christ; we own no Christ but one, the Son of God from Everlasting to Everlasting, who was manifest in Flesh in the Fulness of time, who was born of the Virgin, and went up and down doing Good, preacht Righteousness, wrought Miracles, and according to the Flesh dyed, and was laid in the Sepulchre, rose again the third day, and ascended, according to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Because the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm, The Life of God, which is the Light of Men is utterly faultless or Sinless, J. C. saith, <hi>This is plainly to say, that never was any Sin, nor ever shall be Devils and damned Wretches; Godly and Ʋngodly, we be all holy, spotless and unerring,</hi> see Quak. subv. p. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a horrible Slander, and Perversion of our words; for the Life of God, which is the Light of Men is everlastingly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it cannot sin; and we do believe there is a great deal of Sin in thee, &amp; great abundance in the World, &amp; most of all in the Devil, who is the Author of it; and the Light within convinceth thee and the rest of the World which lieth in Wickedness, of your Sin,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96767:71"/>and reproves you for it, to that end that you may forsake it, and the Devil who is the Author of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> in page 36. thou tellest a great Lye against the Light within, thus, <hi>Every sin I commit the Light within is guilty, as being my self, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The Light within is not guilty of any sin thou ever didst or canst commit; it is not thy self, but thy self rebels against it; and if thou wouldst be Christ's Disciple, thou must believe in the Light and obey it, and it will teach thee to deny thy self and the Devil and all his Works of Lying. Envy, Hypocrisie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here follows a cursed Lying Insinuation of <hi>John Cheyney</hi>'s, thus, <hi>As if</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>should say to all the sinners in the World, You must not meddle with the Scriptures, you are all more Holy then the Scriptures, — Believe not Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c. see Quak. subv. p. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> saith, <hi>If I say ought against Equity and Charity, reprove and convince me, if I bring not Evidences for what I say, call me a Slanderer, and a false Accuser,</hi> see Sermons of Hypocrisie, p. 136.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These thy Lyes and Blasphemies are against Equity and Charity; thou canst never prove what thou hast said and printed against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nay, all the Lyars upon the Earth, as also the Devil who is the Author of them can never do it; so then according to thy Grant, I must call thee a Slanderer, and a false Accuser, and so indeed thou art a great one, even the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est against the <hi>Quakers</hi> that ever I read of to my Knowledge, except the Devil who is the Father of all Lyes and Lyars.</p>

                  <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I would from the bottom of my Heart it were so; for if it were so, thou wouldst be a Holy Man, yea, perfectly holy; then should we not have had such bundles of Lyes &amp; Blasphemies from thee in Print, as we have had. Alas! thou art a Vain Boaster, a self-conceited crazed Man; thou art yet in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> spiritually, where our Lord was crucified; thy Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96767:71"/>against the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, and thy Lyes &amp; Envy against the Children of it, together with thy Notorious Self-contradictions and wild distracted Arguments and hypocritical Prayers, and dissembling with God, and uttering Untruths unto him, the last of which thou confessest, see <hi>Call to Prayer,</hi> p. 141. these do largely prove thee to be yet a Servant to the Devil; the Doctrine of Christ Jesus the Light of the World stands over thy Head in Judgment, who saith, <hi>The Devil is a Lyar and the Father of it;</hi> and also saith, <hi>Every Tree shall be known by its Fruits; a good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can an evil Tree bring forth good Fruit, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cannot bring forth at the same place bitter Water and fresh,</hi> &amp;c. Thou art a corrupt Tree, who hast brought forth much Fruit of lyes, blasphemy and envy; thou art a corrupt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who sends forth thy foul, corrupt, muddy Waters, by which thou hast corrupted the Hearts of those whom thou hast taught to believe thy Blasphemies against the true Light, and thy Lyes against the Children of it.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do not make a new Law of Speech, but do own and practise the same Form of <hi>Theeing</hi> and <hi>Thouing</hi> which was practised by God himself, and by <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; but it appears, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Complices have made a new law of Speech contrary to God's, saying <hi>You</hi> to one single Person: And though such do dayly <hi>Thou</hi> God in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet they count it a Dishonour to them to be <hi>Thou'd</hi> and <hi>Thee'd.</hi> Oh abominable Pride and Deceit! Surely if <hi>You</hi> to one were more honourable then <hi>Thou,</hi> it should be given unto God.</p>
               <p>In page 2. thou sayest, <hi>We must not go to Scripture, Divinity or Morallity to know which is proper and which is improper speaking.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> One would have thought that a man of thy Pretences would have better esteemed the Holy Scriptures, and <hi>Morality</hi> TOO, then to have talked thus; but as in other things, so in this, thy Mouth poureth out Folly. Thou hast denyed the Scriptures of Truth to be any Rule to thee and the men of thy Way concerning Speech or Speaking, which is more then ever I heard before of any who did own God or Christ; thou halt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Morality to be any Rule concerning Speech or Speaking:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96767:72"/>And in page 3. thou sayest, <hi>There is not one Nation or Language that claim Authority over another, and judge their Forms and Phrases of speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Language of God, who said <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Language of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, who said, <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thy</hi> unto God have Power over the Language of the <hi>Pope</hi> and those that have learned of him, who say <hi>Yee</hi> and <hi>You</hi> to a single Person, and <hi>Ʋs</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> of and concerning things that relate to a particular Person only; so the Larguage of God, Christ, the Apostles and Holy Prophets judgeth the Language of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and all who have learned these proud, unscriptural sayings thou having denied the Scriptures and Morality to have any thing to do with thee or any man about proper and improper speaking; thou sayest, <hi>We must go to Dictionaries, Linguists, Grammarians, and Masters in the Art or Science of speaking, and enquire of them, &amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Cheyney,</hi> in the second page of thy <hi>One Sheet,</hi> thou sayst, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do condemn Christian-People for Bowing, and Putting off Hats, and Christian Salutation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We condemn no Christian-People for Christian-Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou slanderest us in this Matter; but thou dost not read in the Scriptures of Truth, that Christ put off <hi>hat</hi> or <hi>cap,</hi> as you do, or that he called such a Practice <hi>Christian-salutation;</hi> neither canst thou read there that the holy Apostles or Prophets put off Hat or Cap, as you do, or that they esteemed such Practice Christian-Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Elihu</hi> said, <hi>Let me not accept any Man's Person, neither let me give flattering Titles unto Man; for I know not to give Flattering Titless in so doing my Maker would soon take me away,</hi> Job 32.21, 22. Your putting off the Hat, and saying, <hi>Your Humble Servant, Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam, &amp;c.</hi> you have not from Christ and his Apostles; but it may be thou mayest throw off Christ and the Apostles, as thou hast thrown off the Scripture, Morality, Accidence and Grammar; and say, that Christ, the Apostles and Prophets have nothing to do to teach thee Salutations, and how thou shouldst behave thy self before Men; but the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> was of another and better Mind then thee, who in Honour to his Master said to the Saints, <hi>He has left you an Example, that you should follow his steps, who did not sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21, 22, 23. Guile is Deceit; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is of the Devil; there was none of that found in his Mouth; but there is a great deal of that found in the Mouthes of many of those which thou callest Christian-People, when they say, <hi>Your Humble Servant, Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> to those whom they neither do serve, nor would be willing to serve, as counting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96767:73"/>far above them, and divers times in perfect Hatred against them: and those that salute on this manner, are far from the Christian Salutation; for, 'tis Vain, Idle and Sinful Words for which an Account must be given unto God. Christ saith, <hi>Learn of me, I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find Rest to your Souls:</hi> A Remnant have learned of him, and have found his Word true, viz. <hi>Rest to their souls;</hi> and such are accounted Fools for his sake by such Temporizing, Feigned, I lattering, Complementers as thou art.</p>
               <p>In the same page thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>make it a Branch of their Religion to be singular from all Christian People, in giving Reverence to men, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a Slander added to thy former score; for we honour or reverence Men, as Christ doth teach us, and has taught his People in former Ages. One while thy Cry is against us for Not Honouring Men; another while, it is for Honouring them, and not after thy unscriptural and unchristlike Form or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, it appears, it would be hard for us to please thee in this Matter; but in this we are satisfied, that we please God in our Salutations to Men, and the rest of our Conversations towards him and all men; and his holy Spirit, which he hath given us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us in all things that appertain to Life and Godliness, doth bear witness to and with our Spirits, that our Salutations unto men do please him, we having this great Witness of the Spirit of God, we little value thy slanderous and clamerous Tongue; thy Slanders and Envy will return upon thy own Head, and if thou Repent not, will become as a Torment of Fire in thy own Bosome.</p>
               <p>In pag. 7. thou sayest, <hi>Christ's Religion doth no way Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Ʋnmannerliness and Rude Behaviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That is true; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> Thouing and Theeing a single Person, as God and <hi>Adam,</hi> yea, Christ, the Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and People of God did, is not Ill Manners, nor Rude Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; neither is the plain Salutation used by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as calling <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> (as Christ and the Apostles did) Unmannerliness or Rude Behaviour; but the Practice of those thou callest Christian People has been Unmannerliness and Rude Behaviour when the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have gone peaceably
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96767:74"/>through your Streets and Markets, and into your Worship Houses to call you to Repentance, then they have been Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Scoffed. Stoned, Beaten with Clubs, Books, Staves, Hands, [several times the Priests Hands] and Blood hath been shed by such as thou callest Christian People at such times; yea, their Skin, Hair and Clothes torn off: and this is like <hi>Cain</hi> the Murderer, and <hi>Judas</hi> with his Company, that came with Clubs and Staves to betray and murder the heavenly Man, Christ Jesus, such hath been the Ill Manners and Rude Behaviour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Members of thy Church against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> even against divers who have not opened their Mouthes to speak to them, within less then 30 years last past: so thou hat no Cause to boast of your good Manners, you have too few of them; and if you do not repent and amend your manners, your Reward will be bitter in the End from the Hand of the Just God: It is your Repentance and Salvation the <hi>Quakers</hi> desire. In the same page thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>do abuse Christian Civility, and Reverence and Worship to Men—Warranted by Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is another Slander for which God will bring thee to Judgment; and you have no Example from Christ, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets for putting off your Hats, and saying; <hi>Your humble Servant Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> and for saying <hi>You</hi> to a single Person; and though thou mention'st Scripture thou hast here brought none, which in the least proves thy Charge against us, nor ever canst thou. In the same page thou sayest, <hi>The Worship you do unto men, is no otherwise unto them, then as they bear God's Image;</hi> and thou sayest, <hi>You do it supreamly to God; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Duty commanded by God, you feel the good and sweet of it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God doth not command you to put off your Hats one to another in Pride and seigned Complementing, nor to say <hi>You</hi> to a single Person; it is Darkness and Blasphemy for thee or any Person to charge these things upon God; thou denyest that the Scriptures or Morality should teach thee or others to speak, and thou hast thrown aside the <hi>Accidence</hi> and <hi>Grammar,</hi> as not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:96767:74"/>
               <p>And thou speakst darkly in saying, the Worship you do to Men, is as they bear God's Image; for Wicked Ungodly Men do not bear, nor are in the Image or Likeness of God; for such being gone out of his Power and Counsel into Wilful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against him, they are, as Christ said, <hi>Of their Father the Devil;</hi> for the <hi>Lusts of their Father they do:</hi> He was and is a Murderer and a Lyar, and Murderers and Lyars are in his Image or Likeness, and not in the Image or Likeness of God, who is a Holy, Pure Fountain of Love, Life, Peace, &amp;c. And if thou art to spirit ally blind, as to think that the outward Body of Man is the Image or Likeness of God, this would suppose God to be like a Man, or in the Form or Shape of a Man; but this whimsical Imagination is judged by the Lord himself, by the Mouth of his Prophet, who saith, <hi>I am God and not Man, the Holy One in the Midst of you,</hi> Hos. 11.9. and by Christ Jesus, who saith, <hi>God is a spirit;</hi> and by <hi>Solomon,</hi> who saith, <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens cannot contain him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the same page and the next following thou mention'st <hi>Boaz</hi> Saluting his Reapers, thus, he said to them, <hi>The Lord be with you,</hi> and they said to him, <hi>The Lord bless thee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Light within doth warrant that Honour which is due to Men, but it doth not warrant your before mentioned Practices; and it is a Slander to say, that in opposing your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ like and unscriptural Salutations, we do contradict our Principle of the Light within; but if it were so as thou sayest, that the Light within pleased thee so well, why dost thou call it <hi>Dagon</hi> and <hi>Dianna?</hi> Oh Deceit!</p>
               <p>Thou further sayest in the same Paragraph, <hi>That the Scriptures, and the History of all Agesis full Proof for your</hi> (Unchrist like, and Unscriptural) <hi>Sayings and Salutations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Abuse and a Slander put upon the Scriptures, as also upon History; for the Scriptures do not warrant or prove your saying <hi>You</hi> to a single Person, nor your saying, <hi>Your humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Sir, Madam,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>In the next and last Paragraph thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themselves and their own Practice; for they call one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends, and by Nods and Signs they salute each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> do call one another <hi>Friends,</hi> and herein they do not contradict themselves, nor Christ Jesus and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostles; for he and they called one another <hi>Friends:</hi> so in this we have Example from Christ and the Apostles, and thou hast standered us herein. And Christ and the Apostles had Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Significations, in which they did salute one another, and so have the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> but neither they, nor the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> did or do put off their Hats (as you do) and Cringe one to another, and say, <hi>Your Humble Servant Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </gap>ing to swear in any Case whatsoever; but we obey the Command of Christ, whose Command is, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> [mark, <hi>not at all</hi>] so we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not swear at all, so here we do not wrest Christ's Words, see <hi>Matthew</hi> Chap. 5 Vers. 34. And the Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>But above all things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by any other Oath; but let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, lest ye fall into Condemnation,</hi> James 5.12. Thus it appears that we have the Command of Christ, and the Doctrine and Exhortation of the Apostle, not to swear at all.</p>
               <p>But it may be thou mayest object, as others of thy Brethren have done, <hi>That Christ and the Apostle did not forbid all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only False Swearing or Forswearing, or Vain and Idle Swearing.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thy Brethren, and those who plead on this manner, do wrest the Scriptures to plead for Swearing under the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Gospel of Christ; for the Law before Christ came in the Flesh did forbid Forswearing, Falle Swearing, Vain or Idle Swearing; for when God gave forth the Commandments to <hi>Israel,</hi> he said, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vain:</hi> To Forswear, or Swear Falsly, or Swear Vainly or Idly, was expresly forbidden, as I have said before, for to do so was and is to make mention of God's Name vainly or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, or to take his Name in vain; and the Lord will not hold such guiltless, as he hath said. God did allow under the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Law, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> might swear by his Name
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96767:76"/>in Truth and Righteousness; this was in Condescension to their Weakness, as it is well observed by some, who have treated upon this Subject. In former time, when <hi>Israel</hi> went a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their God, they learned the Abominations of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> whose Practice was to Swear by their Idols; but God would not suffer <hi>Israel</hi> to go on in that Abomination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said, <hi>Ye shall Swear by my Name in Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> This Christ made mention of when he gave his Command not to swear at all, saying, <hi>Ye have heard, that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not Forswear thy self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oathes.</hi> [Mark] they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Oaths unto the Lord under the Law; but saith Christs <hi>I say unto you, Swear not at all; but let your Communication be Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay; for whatsoever is more then these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Evil.</hi> So then, it is Evil for a <hi>Christian</hi> to swear; and Evil is not of Christ, but of the Evil One; therefore we cannot swear: And if thou wert subject to the Spirit of Christ, thou wouldst not condemn us for Refusing to swear at all, but wouldst be of one Mind with us, who abide herein in the Doctrine of Christ. The Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God; he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son,</hi> see 2 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. So thou, who pleadest for Swearing transgressest and abidest not in the Doctrine of Christ, thou art neither in Subjection to the Father nor the Son, and so art one of the Rebellious Children, who take Counsel, and not of God nor Christ, who cover with a Covering, but not of his Spirit; against such the Prophet of the Lord pronounced Wo. The Law which gave Liberty to Man to swear by the Name of the Lord in Truth and Righteousness, did also require an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, &amp;c. Christ saith, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemies; but I say unto you, Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, &amp; pray for them which despightfully use you and persecute you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> here take notice, Christ sets up Love instead of Hatred, and Blessing instead of Cursing, and Prayer for Enemies instead of Rendring them Evil for Evil; yea, he commands to do good to them that despightfully use and persecute.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:96767:77"/>
               <p>Again, he saith, <hi>Ye have heard by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adultry; but I say unto you, Whosoever looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery already with her in his Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. C.</hi> take notice, the Law commandeth they should not commit Adultery, but Christ forbiddeth to look on a Woman to lust after her: The Law judgeth the Outward Act of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but Christ and his Gospel judgeth the upchast Looks and unclean Desires in the Heart and Mind. Thus it appears, that Christ is the great Reformer and Restorer of Mankind unto God, who believe in and obey him, he brings them to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Enemies, and to pray for them, and do them good; and he brings his to be chast minded, he sanctifies their Eyes, and whole Bodies, Spirits and Souls; he brings them to Plainness in Testimony and Witness bearing before Magistrates, and upon all Occasions, to say <hi>Yea</hi> when it is <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> when it is <hi>Nay,</hi> according to his Command, but not to swear at all. Christ and his Apostles, and the true <hi>Christians</hi> in those days, did not swear by the Bible or Book, nor kiss it: To Swear by the Bible, is to swear by Creature or Creatures, Thing or Things; and this kind of Swearing is forbidden both under the Law &amp; Gospel, therefore it ill becomes thee, who professest thy self to be a Gospel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, to plead for this kind of Swearing, or for Swearing at all; and if that which Christ and the Apostle said against Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not satisfie thee, that <hi>Swearing is utterly Ʋnlawful for a Christian,</hi> then thou mayest upon the same Ground thou pleadest for Swearing amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> also plead that it is lawful for <hi>Christians</hi> to hate their Enemies, seek and take Revenge, render them Evil for Evil; and upon the same Ground thou mayst plead it lawful for a Man to look upon a Woman, &amp; to lust after her, all which is expresly against Christ's Command; and if thou teach People thus to do, thou wilt make them <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and no <hi>Christians;</hi> for the True <hi>Christian</hi> abideth in Christ, who is the living Vine, and by his Virtue a <hi>Christian</hi> is enabled to abide in his Doctrine, who saith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and who judgeth the Unchast Mind, and Unsatisfied Eye, and Malicious Heart, and Bloody Hands; those who come to him, he baptizeth with the Holy Ghost or Spirit, which as Fire burns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96767:77"/>up Lusts, Malice and all the Devil's Works; so if any man be in Christ he is a new Creature, old things are passed away, as said the Apostle, and all things are become new: Mistrust, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and Unfaithfulness are passed away, and the Lip of Truth, which is establisht forever, is come unto.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>John Cheyney</hi> concerning Conscience: In general terms he cites and indicts the Unsanctified and Unsound, and chargeth them with the Crime of Hypocrisie; and he saith, <hi>The Judge and Witness against them, is Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, here take notice, J. C. doth set up Conscience a great height, even the Consciences of wicked men, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not, for the Apostle did distinguish betwixt Good and Evil Conscience, as I have shewed in the Beginning of this Book. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I speak the Truth in Christ,</hi> mark, <hi>In Christ, I lye not, my Conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Mark the Apostle's Good Conscience was govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Ghost, or Spirit of God and Christ, and so are all Good Consciences, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 1. Again he saith, <hi>I have lived in all Good Conscience before God unto this Day,</hi> Acts 23.1. <hi>The End of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart, and of a Good Conscience, and of Faith Ʋnfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. <hi>Holding the Mystery of Faith in a Pure Conscience,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.9. Reader, thus the Apostle speaks of Conscience, as it is Good and Pure, in such Consciences the Christian-charity doth dwell, and it shews it self in its blessed Fruits of Truth, Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, &amp;c. amongst men, to the Praise of God, and to the Good and Comfort of Men and Women.</p>
               <p>But on the other Hand, where Conscience is defiled, and so is become Evil, the contrary Fruits do appear. The Apostle saith, <hi>Them that are defiled,—Even their Mind and Conscience is DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FILED,</hi> Tit 1.15. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy, To hold Faith and a Good Conscience, which some having put away,</hi> mark, <hi>put away,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96767:79"/>concerning Faith have made Shipwrack,</hi> 1 Tim. 19. Mark Reader, when these men had put away Faith and a Good Conscience, they had neither Faith not Good Conscience, yet no doubt they talked of Faith &amp; Good Conscience, after they had put away both, like <hi>Banckrupts,</hi> who, when they have spent what they once had, by riotous living, yet in Deceit love to boast of that which they have not, such were they of whom the Apostle speaks thus— <hi>Speaking Lyes in Hypocrisie, having their Consciences</hi> [SEA RED WITH AN HOT IRON] Reader, an Evil, Unclean, Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conscience is neither good Judge nor Witness, though <hi>John Cheyney</hi> tells the Unsanctified, whom he chargeth with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, that their Consciences are both Judge and Witness— I perceive where J. C's. Mistake lies in this Matter; <hi>First,</hi> he should have distinguished betwixt Evil and Good Conscience, which he hath not done. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He should have shewed, if he could, as the Apostle did, that Good Conscience lives in the Holy Spirit, Life and Light of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Men go from that, they put away a Good Conscience, and make Shipwrack of Faith. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If Men come not to believe in, and obey the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, they neither have True Faith, nor Good Conscience; for it is the Life of God, which lighteth every one that cometh into the World, that doth give a Sound Understanding, and Right Knowledge of the things of God: Man coming to that, his Understanding and Knowledge given thereby is True and Sound; and he keeping in that Life, it keeps his Heart tender, and in that Tenderness he obeys God in Faithfulness, and lives and acts justly unto all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple through Christ, who is his Life, Light and Way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he is strengthned to love and obey God with all his Heart, &amp; to love his Neighbour as himself &amp; such a man's Conscience will bear witness unto him in the Holy Ghost, Spirit or Light: So this Holy Ghost, Spirit, Life or Light is the Standard and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring Line, which doth never alter; to this all men ought to bring their Deeds, that by <hi>IT</hi> they might be tryed, measured and judged, that by it they might know what Works are wrought in God, and what not; and this is according to Christ's Doctrine, who saith, <hi>Every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, and will not bring his Deeds to the Light, lest they should be reproved; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96767:80"/>one that doth Truth bringeth his Deeds to the Light, that they may be made manifest that they are wrought in God,</hi> mark, <hi>In God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>J.C. talks of the Light &amp; coming to it in the before cited page but he doth not tell what it is he calls Light: To the true Light wherewith Christ lighteth every one that comes into the World, he doth appear to be an avowed Enemy, of which his Books give large proof; but had he been a Believer in the true Light, and a diligent walker in it, he would have had Skill and Honesty to have distinguisht betwixt evil and good Conscience, and also he would have commended the Life, Spirit or Light of God and Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to People, as the chief Touch-Stone, Standard and Measuring. Line for all People to bring their deeds to, to be tryed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might know which are wrought in God, and have Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp; Peace in them; but that such, whose works are wrought in the Power of Darkness, might know them judg'd, and that they might repent of them, and be forgiven, and cease from them; but of this good work J. C. falls short.</p>
               <p>In p. 216. J.C. affirms, <hi>That Conscience is defiled</hi>—Again in the same page he affirms, <hi>That Conscience is the Stock or Root, and as is the Root so is all that gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s on it.</hi>—Again in the same page he saith, <hi>Conscience bring the great Ordinance of God,</hi> &amp;c. Reader note here, J.C affirms, that Conscience is defiled, and that it is the Stock or Root, and as is the Root, so is all that grows on it, so by this he renders People wholely defiled, and in Defilement, and so of the Devil; and when he hath thus thrown down <hi>Conscience,</hi> as it were to Hell, though immediately before he sets it up above the Life of God, which is the Light of Men.—Then he calls it the great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and so chargeth the great Ordinance of God to be defiled, and so the Devil to have place in it and power over it. O Confusion, Blasphemy and Darkness!</p>
               <p>In p. 100 he saith unto them who are <hi>Ʋnsanctified &amp; Ʋnsound, I cite you to appear at the Bar of Conscience, I indict you all, and charge you with the Crime of Hypocrisie, my witness against you is your own Conscience, I appeal to each man's Conscience for conviction &amp; tryal of the Cause—This is both Judge and Witness, for &amp; under God within you.</hi> Note Reader, here J.C. chargeth God foolishly; he saith, the Consciences of the Unsound and Unsanctified, whom he chargeth with the crime of Hypocrisie, is both Judge and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                  <hi>Answ</hi> It is Blasphemy, as I have proved before, to say, that the Life of God, which is the Light of Men, is Darkness, or that it is a sinful, defiled, self destroying Light. The Apostle said, <hi>God hath shined in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, and this Treasure have we in earthen Vessels,</hi> 2 Cor 4.6, 7. <hi>that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Power may be of God and not of us</hi> (mark) <hi>Not of us;</hi> and Christ said to the Father, <hi>This is Life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ which thou hast sent.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>We know the Son of God is come, and has given us an unde standing that we might know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and Eternal Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. But the Apostle

                  <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of some unfaithful ones, who had not the Knowledge of God, and he said, <hi>I speak this to your Shame,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.34. but the Apostle knew how God shined in the heart and soul, who said, <hi>He hath shined in our hearts to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, and this Treasure have we in earthen Vessels,</hi> &amp;c. so it appears he did not only know how God shined, but for what end, to wit, to give them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Glory, and he knew they had this Treasure in earthen Vessels, to wit, in their mortal Bodies; he knew by this Inshining of God, they had the Knowledge of God given, and Power also to do his Will; and therefore he said, <hi>The Excellency of the Power was of God, and not of him or of them,</hi> who believed in it: So because of his Inshining upon their Souls, they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

To be a Child of Light is to be a Child of God; for <hi>God is Light,</hi> 1 Joh. 5, 6, 7. but if still thou continuest rebellious against the Light, and in thy Rebellion further contendest against it, then thou wilt be more and more swadled in the Bands of Darkness and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion [according to thy own Principle] wherein thy Folly will still be the more manifest.
